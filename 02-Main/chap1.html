<p>Law in the United States is a heavily regulated industry. Lawyers are licensed in each state. They are governed by profesional rules, usually adopted and enforced by state supreme courts. The courts regulate lawyers separately as well, through supervisory decisions in the course of litigation and by implementing common law civil liability rules that govern legal practice. These include malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and other causes of action. Administrative agencies—particularly federal agencies—also establish and implement rules governing lawyers who practice before them. Federal and state legislatures play a further ruole in regulating the bar, providing statutory regulations and criminal penalties that apply to lawyers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, courts, commentators, and legal ethics regulators continue to conceptualize law as a “self-regulated profession.” … The preamble to the recently revised ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct maintains an emphasis on the importance of self-regulation desipite the fact that the Rules are intended to be adopted as enforceable by state supreme courts.</p>

<section id="preamble-a-lawyers-responsibilities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preamble-a-lawyers-responsibilities">Preamble: A Lawyer’s Responsibilities</h4>
<p>[1] A lawyer, as a member of the legal profession, is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.</p>
<p>[2] As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed understanding of the client’s legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client’s position under the rules of the adversary system. As negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealings with others. As an evaluator, a lawyer acts by examining a client’s legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.</p>
<p>[3] In addition to these representational functions, a lawyer may serve as a third-party neutral, a nonrepresentational role helping the parties to resolve a dispute or other matter. Some of these Rules apply directly to lawyers who are or have served as third-party neutrals. See, e.g., Rules 1.12 and 2.4. In addition, there are Rules that apply to lawyers who are not active in the practice of law or to practicing lawyers even when they are acting in a nonprofessional capacity. For example, a lawyer who commits fraud in the conduct of a business is subject to discipline for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. See Rule 8.4.</p>
<p>[4] In all professional functions a lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure is required or permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</p>
<p>[5] A lawyer’s conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer’s business and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law’s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer’s duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also a lawyer’s duty to uphold legal process.</p>
<p>[6] As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, access to the legal system, the administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. In addition, a lawyer should further the public’s understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice system because legal institutions in a constitutional democracy depend on popular participation and support to maintain their authority. A lawyer should be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance. Therefore, all lawyers should devote professional time and resources and use civic influence to ensure equal access to our system of justice for all those who because of economic or social barriers cannot afford or secure adequate legal counsel. A lawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.</p>
<p>[7] Many of a lawyer’s professional responsibilities are prescribed in the Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as substantive and procedural law. However, a lawyer is also guided by personal conscience and the approbation of professional peers. A lawyer should strive to attain the highest level of skill, to improve the law and the legal profession and to exemplify the legal profession’s ideals of public service.</p>
<p>[8] A lawyer’s responsibilities as a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen are usually harmonious. Thus, when an opposing party is well represented, a lawyer can be a zealous advocate on behalf of a client and at the same time assume that justice is being done. So also, a lawyer can be sure that preserving client confidences ordinarily serves the public interest because people are more likely to seek legal advice, and thereby heed their legal obligations, when they know their communications will be private.</p>
<p>[9] In the nature of law practice, however, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from conflict between a lawyer’s responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer’s own interest in remaining an ethical person while earning a satisfactory living. The Rules of Professional Conduct often prescribe terms for resolving such conflicts. Within the framework of these Rules, however, many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. Such issues must be resolved through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the Rules. These principles include the lawyer’s obligation zealously to protect and pursue a client’s legitimate interests, within the bounds of the law, while maintaining a professional, courteous and civil attitude toward all persons involved in the legal system.</p>
<p>[10] The legal profession is largely self-governing. Although other professions also have been granted powers of self-government, the legal profession is unique in this respect because of the close relationship between the profession and the processes of government and law enforcement. This connection is manifested in the fact that ultimate authority over the legal profession is vested largely in the courts.</p>
<p>[11] To the extent that lawyers meet the obligations of their professional calling, the occasion for government regulation is obviated. Self-regulation also helps maintain the legal profession’s independence from government domination. An independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse of legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on government for the right to practice.</p>
<p>[12] The legal profession’s relative autonomy carries with it special responsibilities of self-government. The profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulations are conceived in the public interest and not in furtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar. Every lawyer is responsible for observance of the Rules of Professional Conduct. A lawyer should also aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.</p>
<p>[13] Lawyers play a vital role in the preservation of society. The fulfillment of this role requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship to our legal system. The Rules of Professional Conduct, when properly applied, serve to define that relationship.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope">Scope</h4>
<p>[14] The Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason. They should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law itself. Some of the Rules are imperatives, cast in the terms “shall” or “shall not.” These define proper conduct for purposes of professional discipline. Others, generally cast in the term “may,” are permissive and define areas under the Rules in which the lawyer has discretion to exercise professional judgment. No disciplinary action should be taken when the lawyer chooses not to act or acts within the bounds of such discretion. Other Rules define the nature of relationships between the lawyer and others. The Rules are thus partly obligatory and disciplinary and partly constitutive and descriptive in that they define a lawyer’s professional role. Many of the Comments use the term “should.” Comments do not add obligations to the Rules but provide guidance for practicing in compliance with the Rules.</p>
<p>[15] The Rules presuppose a larger legal context shaping the lawyer’s role. That context includes court rules and statutes relating to matters of licensure, laws defining specific obligations of lawyers and substantive and procedural law in general. The Comments are sometimes used to alert lawyers to their responsibilities under such other law.</p>
<p>[16] Compliance with the Rules, as with all law in an open society, depends primarily upon understanding and voluntary compliance, secondarily upon reinforcement by peer and public opinion and finally, when necessary, upon enforcement through disciplinary proceedings. The Rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The Rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law.</p>
<p>[17] Furthermore, for purposes of determining the lawyer’s authority and responsibility, principles of substantive law external to these Rules determine whether a client-lawyer relationship exists. Most of the duties flowing from the client-lawyer relationship attach only after the client has requested the lawyer to render legal services and the lawyer has agreed to do so. But there are some duties, such as that of confidentiality under Rule 1.6, that attach when the lawyer agrees to consider whether a client-lawyer relationship shall be established. See Rule 1.18. Whether a client-lawyer relationship exists for any specific purpose can depend on the circumstances and may be a question of fact.</p>
<p>[18] Under various legal provisions, including constitutional, statutory and common law, the responsibilities of government lawyers may include authority concerning legal matters that ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships. For example, a lawyer for a government agency may have authority on behalf of the government to decide upon settlement or whether to appeal from an adverse judgment. Such authority in various respects is generally vested in the attorney general and the state’s attorney in state government, and their federal counterparts, and the same may be true of other government law officers. Also, lawyers under the supervision of these officers may be authorized to represent several government agencies in intragovernmental legal controversies in circumstances where a private lawyer could not represent multiple private clients. These Rules do not abrogate any such authority.</p>
<p>[19] Failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a Rule is a basis for invoking the disciplinary process. The Rules presuppose that disciplinary assessment of a lawyer’s conduct will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the conduct in question and in recognition of the fact that a lawyer often has to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence of the situation. Moreover, the Rules presuppose that whether or not discipline should be imposed for a violation, and the severity of a sanction, depend on all the circumstances, such as the willfulness and seriousness of the violation, extenuating factors and whether there have been previous violations.</p>
<p>[20] Violation of a Rule should not itself give rise to a cause of action against a lawyer nor should it create any presumption in such a case that a legal duty has been breached. In addition, violation of a Rule does not necessarily warrant any other nondisciplinary remedy, such as disqualification of a lawyer in pending litigation. The Rules are designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not designed to be a basis for civil liability. Furthermore, the purpose of the Rules can be subverted when they are invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons. The fact that a Rule is a just basis for a lawyer’s self-assessment, or for sanctioning a lawyer under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply that an antagonist in a collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to seek enforcement of the Rule. Nevertheless, since the Rules do establish standards of conduct by lawyers, a lawyer’s violation of a Rule may be evidence of breach of the applicable standard of conduct.</p>
<p>[21] The Comment accompanying each Rule explains and illustrates the meaning and purpose of the Rule. The Preamble and this note on Scope provide general orientation. The Comments are intended as guides to interpretation, but the text of each Rule is authoritative.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="note-judicial-legislative-administrative-regulation">Note: Judicial, Legislative, &amp; Administrative Regulation</h3>
<p>Courts and other tribunals regulate the conduct of attorneys who appear before them. Court rules and judicial statutes may impose standards of conduct and authorize the imposition of sanctions on attorneys who breach those standards. See, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11">FRCP Rule 11</a> (sanctions for asserting frivilous or bad faith claims, defenses, or arguments in pleadings and motions); <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_37">FRCP Rule 37</a> (sanctions for failing to make required disclosures or cooperate in discovery); 28 U.S. Code § 1927 (sactions against “attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously”).</p>
<p>In addition to the express authority conferred by statutes or practice rules, courts possess “inherent authority” to regulate the conduct of attorneys who appear before them. See, e.g., N.C. Gen.&nbsp;Stat. § 84-36 (“Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as disabling or abridging the inherent powers of the court to deal with its attorneys.”)</p>
<p>Attorney conduct is also subject to legislative and administrative regulation. Some statutes and agency rules apply specifically to lawyers, while others apply to certain conduct by lawyers and non-lawyers alike.</p>
<p>For example, in Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Congress directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to “issue rules, in the public interest and for the protection of investors, setting forth minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the Commission in any way in the representation of issuers.” The Act specifically calls for rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) requiring an attorney to report evidence of a material violation of securities law or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the company or any agent thereof, to the chief legal counsel or the chief executive officer of the company (or the equivalent thereof); and</p></li>
<li><p>(2) if the counsel or officer does not appropriately respond to the evidence (adopting, as necessary, appropriate remedial measures or sanctions with respect to the violation), requiring the attorney to report the evidence to the audit committee of the board of directors of the issuer or to another committee of the board of directors comprised solely of directors not employed directly or indirectly by the issuer, or to the board of directors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>15 U.S.C. § 7245. The SEC rules set out standards and procedures for mandatory reporting by attorneys (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/part-205">17 C.F.R. §§ 205.3-205.5</a>). Attorneys who violate those are subject to “the civil penalties and remedies for a violation of the federal securities laws available to the Commission in an action brought by the Commission thereunder,” § 205.6(a), as well as disciplinary proceedings by the Commission,” which “may result in an attorney being censured, or being temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission,” § 205.6(b). They “may also be subject to discipline for the same conduct in a jurisdiction where the attorney is admitted or practices.” § 205.6(b).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) Conviction of, or a tender and acceptance of a plea of guilty or no contest to, a criminal offense showing professional unfitness;</p></li>
<li><p>(2) The violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct adopted and promulgated by the Council in effect at the time of the act;</p></li>
<li><p>(3) Knowing misrepresentation of any facts or circumstances surrounding any complaint, allegation or charge of misconduct; failure to answer any formal inquiry or complaint issued by or in the name of the North Carolina State Bar in any disciplinary matter; or contempt of the Council or any committee of the North Carolina State Bar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(c) Misconduct by any attorney shall be grounds for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) Disbarment;</p></li>
<li><p>(2) Suspension for a period up to but not exceeding five years, any portion of which may be stayed upon reasonable conditions to which the offending attorney consents;</p></li>
<li><p>(3) Censure - A censure is a written form of discipline more serious than a reprimand issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused significant harm or potential significant harm to a client, the administration of justice, the profession or members of the public, but the protection of the public does not require suspension of the attorney’s license;</p></li>
<li><p>(4) Reprimand - A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, but the protection of the public does not require a censure. A reprimand is generally reserved for cases in which the attorney’s conduct has caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the profession, or members of the public; or</p></li>
<li><p>(5) Admonition - An admonition is a written form of discipline imposed in cases in which an attorney has committed a minor violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Any order disbarring or suspending an attorney may impose reasonable conditions precedent to reinstatement. No attorney who has been disbarred by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission, the Council, or by order of any court of this State may seek reinstatement to the practice of law prior to five years from the effective date of the order of disbarment. Any order of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission or the Grievance Committee imposing an admonition, reprimand, censure, or stayed suspension may also require the attorney to complete a reasonable amount of continuing legal education in addition to the minimum amount required by the North Carolina Supreme Court.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(d) Any attorney admitted to practice law in this State, who is convicted of or has tendered and has had accepted, a plea of guilty or no contest to, a criminal offense showing professional unfitness, may be disciplined based upon the conviction, without awaiting the outcome of any appeals of the conviction. An order of discipline based solely upon a conviction of a criminal offense showing professional unfitness shall be vacated immediately upon receipt by the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar of a certified copy of a judgment or order reversing the conviction. The fact that the attorney’s criminal conviction has been overturned on appeal shall not prevent the North Carolina State Bar from conducting a disciplinary proceeding against the attorney based upon the same underlying facts or events that were the subject of the criminal proceeding.</p>
<p>(d1) An attorney who is disciplined as provided in subsection (d) of this section may petition the court in the trial division in the judicial district where the conviction occurred for an order staying the disciplinary action pending the outcome of any appeals of the conviction. The court may grant or deny the stay in its discretion upon such terms as it deems proper. A stay of the disciplinary action by the court shall not prevent the North Carolina State Bar from going forward with a disciplinary proceeding against the attorney based upon the same underlying facts or events that were the subject of the criminal proceeding.</p>
<p>(e) Any attorney admitted to practice law in this State who is disciplined in another jurisdiction shall be subject to the same discipline in this State: Provided, that the discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction does not exceed that provided for in subsection (c) above and that the attorney was not deprived of due process in the other jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(f) Upon application by the North Carolina State Bar, misconduct by an attorney admitted to practice in this State may be restrained or enjoined where the necessity for prompt action exists regardless of whether a disciplinary proceeding in the matter of the conduct is pending. The application shall be filed in the Superior Court of Wake County and shall be governed by the procedure set forth in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 65.</p>
<p>(g) Any member of the North Carolina State Bar may be transferred to disability inactive status for mental incompetence, physical disability, or substance abuse interfering with the attorney’s ability to competently engage in the practice of law under the rules and procedures the Council adopts pursuant to G.S. 84-23.</p>
<p>(h) There shall be an appeal of right by either party from any final order of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. Review by the appellate division shall be upon matters of law or legal inference. The procedures governing any appeal shall be as provided by statute or court rule for appeals in civil cases. A final order which imposes disbarment or suspension for 18 months or more shall not be stayed except upon application, under the rules of the Court of Appeals, for a writ of supersedeas. A final order imposing suspension for less than 18 months or any other discipline except disbarment shall be stayed pending determination of any appeal of right.</p>
<p>(i) The North Carolina State Bar may invoke the process of the General Court of Justice to enforce the powers of the Council or any committee to which the Council delegates its authority.</p>
<p>(j) The North Carolina State Bar may apply to appropriate courts for orders necessary to protect the interests of clients of missing, suspended, disbarred, disabled, or deceased attorneys.</p>
<ul>
<li>The senior regular resident judge of the superior court of any district wherein a member of the North Carolina State Bar resides or maintains an office shall have the authority and power to enter orders necessary to protect the interests of the clients, including the authority to order the payment of compensation by the member or the estate of a deceased or disabled member to any attorney appointed to administer or conserve the law practice of the member. Compensation awarded to a member serving under this section awarded from the estate of a deceased member shall be considered an administrative expense of the estate for purposes of determining priority of payment.</li>

<p>This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Michael G. Riehlmann, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<section id="underlying-facts" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="underlying-facts">Underlying Facts</h4>
<p>Respondent is a criminal defense attorney who was formerly employed as an Assistant District Attorney in the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office. One evening in April 1994, respondent met his close friend and law school classmate, Gerry Deegan, at a bar near the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court. Like respondent, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had been a prosecutor in the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office before he “switched sides” in 1987. During their conversation in the bar, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan told respondent that he had that day learned he was dying of colon cancer. In the same conversation, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan confided to respondent that he had suppressed exculpatory blood evidence in a criminal case he prosecuted while at the District Attorney’s Office. Respondent recalls that he was “surprised” and “shocked” by his friend’s revelation, and that he urged Mr.&nbsp;Deegan to “remedy” the situation. It is undisputed that respondent did not report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s disclosure to anyone at the time it was made. Mr.&nbsp;Deegan died in July 1994, having done nothing to “remedy” the situation of which he had spoken in the bar.</p>
<p>Nearly five years after Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s death, one of the defendants whom he had prosecuted in a 1985 armed robbery case was set to be executed by lethal injection on May 20, 1999. In April 1999, the lawyers for the defendant, John Thompson, discovered a crime lab report which contained the results of tests performed on a piece of pants leg and a tennis shoe that were stained with the perpetrator’s blood during a scuffle with the victim of the robbery attempt. The crime lab report concluded that the robber had Type “B” blood. Because Mr.&nbsp;Thompson has Type “O” blood, the crime lab report proved he could not have committed the robbery; nevertheless, neither the crime lab report nor the blood-stained physical evidence had been disclosed to Mr.&nbsp;Thompson’s defense counsel prior to or during trial. Respondent claims that when he heard about the inquiry of Mr.&nbsp;Thompson’s lawyers, he immediately realized that this was the case to which Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had referred in their April 1994 conversation in the bar. On April 27, 1999, respondent executed an affidavit for Mr.&nbsp;Thompson in which he attested that during the 1994 conversation, “the late Gerry Deegan said to me that he had intentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson that in some way exculpated the defendant.”</p>
<p>In May 1999, respondent reported Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct to the ODC. In June 1999, respondent testified in a hearing on a motion for new trial in Mr.&nbsp;Thompson’s armed robbery case. During the hearing, respondent testified that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had told him that he “suppressed exculpatory evidence that was blood evidence, that seemed to have excluded Mr.&nbsp;Thompson as the perpetrator of an armed robbery.” Respondent also admitted that he “should have reported” Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct, and that while he ultimately did so, “I should have reported it sooner, I guess.”</p>
<p>On September 30, 1999, respondent gave a sworn statement to the ODC in which he was asked why he did not report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s disclosure to anyone at the time it was made. Respondent replied:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I think that under ordinary circumstances, I would have. I really honestly think I’m a very good person. And I think I do the right thing whenever I’m given the opportunity to choose. This was unquestionably the most difficult time of my life. Gerry, who was like a brother to me, was dying. And that was, to say distracting would be quite an understatement. I’d also left my wife just a few months before, with three kids, and was under the care of a psychiatrist, taking antidepressants. My youngest son was then about two and had just recently undergone open-heart surgery. I had a lot on my plate at the time. A great deal of it of my own making; there’s no question about it. But, nonetheless, I was very, very distracted, and I simply did not give it the important consideration that it deserved. But it was a very trying time for me. And that’s the only explanation I have, because, otherwise, I would have reported it immediately had I been in a better frame of mind.</p>

<section id="formal-charges" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formal-charges">Formal Charges</h5>
<p>On January 4, 2001, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that his failure to report his unprivileged knowledge of Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s prosecutorial misconduct violated Rules 8.3(a) (reporting professional misconduct), 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The ODC subsequently amended the formal charges to delete the alleged violation of Rule 8.4(c).</p>
<p>On March 5, 2002, respondent answered the amended formal charges and admitted some of the factual allegations therein, but denied that his conduct violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. Specifically, respondent asserted that Rule 8.3(a) “merely requires that an attorney possessing unprivileged knowledge of a violation of this Code shall report such knowledge to the authority empowered to investigate such acts. It is undisputed that respondent did report his knowledge of Deegan’s statements to Thompson’s attorneys, with the clear understanding that this information would be reported to the District Attorney and the Court, undeniably authorities empowered to investigate Deegan’s conduct.”</p>
</section>
<section id="formal-hearing" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formal-hearing">Formal Hearing</h5>
<p>When this matter proceeded to a formal hearing before the committee, respondent testified that his best recollection of his conversation with Mr.&nbsp;Deegan in 1994 “is that he told me that he did not turn over evidence to his opponents that might have exculpated the defendant.” Nevertheless, when asked whether he recognized during the barroom conversation that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had violated his ethical duties, respondent replied, “Well, certainly.” Respondent admitted that he gave the conversation no further thought after he left the bar because he was “distracted” by his own personal problems.</p>
</section>
<section id="hearing-committee-recommendation" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hearing-committee-recommendation">Hearing Committee Recommendation</h5>
<p>In its report filed with the disciplinary board, the hearing committee concluded that respondent did not violate Rule 8.3(a), but that he should be publicly reprimanded for his violation of Rule 8.4(d).</p>
<p>Considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the committee made a factual finding that during the 1994 barroom conversation, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan explained to respondent that he did not turn over evidence in a case that might have exculpated a defendant, but “equivocated on whether the evidence proved the innocence of a defendant.” Moreover, the committee found there is no clear and convincing evidence that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan identified John Thompson by name in the disclosure to respondent in 1994. The committee believed respondent’s testimony that he did not draw a connection between Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s 1994 statements and the Thompson case until 1999, when he heard about the inquiry of Mr.&nbsp;Thompson’s lawyers.</p>
<p>Based on its factual findings, the committee found that respondent did not violate Rule 8.3(a) because he did not have “knowledge of a violation” that obligated him to report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan to the ODC or to any other authority. The committee pointed out that it believed respondent’s testimony that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan made equivocal statements in 1994 that did not rise to the level of a “confession” that Deegan had actually suppressed the crime lab report nine years earlier. The committee found Mr.&nbsp;Deegan qualified his statement that the evidence “might” have exculpated the defendant, and furthermore, agreed that if the evidence did not tend to negate the defendant’s guilt, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan would have had no obligation to turn over that evidence under <em>Brady</em>. Consequently, the committee determined that respondent would have had no violation to report. The committee found Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s statements at most suggested a potential violation of the ethical rules, but the committee declined to construe Rule 8.3(a) to require a lawyer to report a potential violation of an ethical rule by another lawyer.</p>
<p>Although the committee did not find that respondent violated Rule 8.3(a), the committee found he violated Rule 8.4(d), which imposes a “broader obligation to ensure that justice is fairly administered,” by his “complete inaction after the barroom disclosure.” The committee found respondent’s conversation with Mr.&nbsp;Deegan “was of sufficient importance that not pursuing Deegan for a disclosure or to rectify the situation, failing to investigate further, and ultimately not taking any affirmative action for five years constituted conduct that hindered the administration of justice.” The committee determined the baseline sanction for such conduct by respondent is a reprimand.</p>
<p>As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent’s experience in the practice of law (admitted 1983) and the vulnerability of the victim, Mr.&nbsp;Thompson. In mitigation, the committee acknowledged the absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, personal or emotional problems (including the terminal colon cancer of his best friend, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan; marital problems; and the health problems both he and his son were experiencing), timely good faith effort to rectify the consequences of Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct, full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceeding, character and reputation, and remorse.</p>
<p>In light of the mitigating factors present, and finding that a suspension would serve no useful purpose in this case, the committee recommended the imposition of a public reprimand.</p>
<p>Both respondent and the ODC filed objections to the hearing committee’s recommendation.</p>
</section>
<section id="disciplinary-board-recommendation" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disciplinary-board-recommendation">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</h5>
<p>The disciplinary board adopted the hearing committee’s factual findings but rejected its application of Rule 8.3(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board determined that a finding of a violation of Rule 8.3(a) requires clear and convincing evidence that an attorney (1) possessed unprivileged knowledge of an ethical violation and (2) failed to report such knowledge to a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon such violation. Concerning the knowledge requirement, the board considered various legal authorities interpreting both Louisiana Rule 8.3(a) and Model Rule 8.3(a), and determined that a lawyer’s duty to report professional misconduct is triggered when, under the circumstances, a reasonable lawyer would have “a firm opinion that the conduct in question more likely than not occurred.” The board explained that the requisite knowledge under Rule 8.3(a) is “more than a mere suspicion, but less than absolute or moral certainty.”</p>
<p>Employing this analysis, the board concluded the committee erred in its finding that respondent had no duty to report because Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s statements were equivocal. The board found respondent must have understood from his 1994 conversation with Mr.&nbsp;Deegan that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had suppressed Brady evidence:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If Respondent did not understand from his conversation with Deegan that Deegan has suppressed evidence that he was obligated to produce, why was Respondent shocked and surprised? Why did Respondent tell Deegan that what he had done was “not right” and that Deegan had to “rectify” the situation? Respondent never changed his testimony in this respect. Obviously, if Respondent understood from his conversation with Deegan that Deegan had done nothing wrong, there would have been no occasion for Respondent to say that it was “not right” or that Deegan had to “rectify” what he had done. The Committee makes no attempt to explain these circumstances which are wholly inconsistent with the Committee’s theory. This uncontradicted circumstantial evidence cannot be ignored. Indeed, if Deegan believed he had done nothing wrong, why did Deegan even bother to bring the matter up nearly ten (10) years after Thompson was convicted? More importantly, why did he bring it up in the same conversation that he disclosed to Respondent that he (Deegan) had terminal colon cancer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The board concluded that a reasonable lawyer under the circumstances would have formed a firm opinion that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had wrongfully failed to disclose the blood evidence, and that respondent did in fact form such an opinion because he advised Mr.&nbsp;Deegan that what he (Deegan) did was “not right” and that he (Deegan) had to “rectify” the situation. Accordingly, the board found respondent had sufficient knowledge of misconduct by Mr.&nbsp;Deegan to trigger a duty to report the misconduct to the disciplinary authorities.</p>
<p>The board then turned to a discussion of whether respondent’s failure to report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct for more than five years after learning of it constituted a failure to report under Rule 8.3(a). The board acknowledged that Rule 8.3(a) does not provide any specific time limit or period within which the misconduct must be reported. Nevertheless, the board reasoned that Rule 8.3(a) serves no useful purpose unless it is read to require reporting to an appropriate authority within a reasonable time under the circumstances. Therefore, absent special circumstances, the board determined that a lawyer must report his knowledge of misconduct “promptly.” Applying these principles to the instant case, the board determined respondent’s disclosure in 1999 of misconduct he discovered in 1994 was not timely and did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 8.3(a).</p>
<p>The board also found that respondent’s conduct violated Rule 8.4(d) because his inactivity following Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s disclosure was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>
<p>The board found respondent knowingly violated a duty owed to the profession, and that his actions resulted in both actual and potential injury to Mr.&nbsp;Thompson. The board noted that if respondent had taken further action in 1994, when Mr.&nbsp;Deegan made his confession, Mr.&nbsp;Thompson’s innocence in connection with the armed robbery charge may have been established sooner. The board also observed that negative publicity attached to respondent’s actions, thereby causing harm to the legal profession. The board determined the baseline sanction for respondent’s conduct is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>
<p>The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the hearing committee, except that the board refused to credit respondent with the mitigating factor of making a timely good faith effort to rectify the consequences of Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct.</p>
<p>The board determined that some period of suspension is appropriate for respondent’s conduct. In light of the significant mitigating factors in this matter, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months. One board member dissented and would recommend a suspension of at least one year and one day.</p>
<p>Both respondent and the ODC filed objections to the disciplinary board’s recommendation.</p>

<section id="discussion" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h4>
<p>In this matter we are presented for the first time with an opportunity to delineate the scope of an attorney’s duty under Rule 8.3 to report the professional misconduct of a fellow member of the bar. Therefore, we begin our discussion with a few observations relating to the rule and its history.</p>
<p>The American legal profession has long recognized the necessity of reporting lawyers’ ethical misconduct. When the American Bar Association adopted its first code of ethics in 1908, Canon 29 of the Canons of Professional Ethics, entitled “Upholding the Honor of the Profession,” encouraged lawyers to “expose without fear or favor before the proper tribunals corrupt or dishonest conduct in the profession”. More than sixty years later, the ABA enacted Disciplinary Rule 1-103(A) of the Model Code of Professional Responsibility, the predecessor of the current Rule 8.3(a) of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. Both the 1969 Code, in DR 1-103(A), and the 1983 Model Rules, in Rule 8.3(a), make it clear that the duty to report is not merely an aspiration but is mandatory, the violation of which subjects the lawyer to discipline.</p>
<p>This court first adopted Rule 8.3 on December 18, 1986, effective January 1, 1987. Louisiana’s rule is based on ABA Model Rule 8.3; however, there are several differences between the Model Rule and the Louisiana Rule that was in effect in 2001, at the time the formal charges were filed in this case. Most significantly, Model Rule 8.3 requires a lawyer to report the misconduct of another lawyer only when the conduct in question “raises a substantial question” as to that lawyer’s fitness to practice. Louisiana’s version of Rule 8.3 imposed a substantially more expansive reporting requirement, in that our rule required a lawyer to report all unprivileged knowledge of any ethical violation by a lawyer, whether the violation was, in the reporting lawyer’s view, flagrant and substantial or minor and technical. A task force of the Louisiana State Bar Association concluded that it was inappropriate to put a lawyer “in the position of making a subjective judgment” regarding the significance of a violation, and felt it was preferable instead “to put the burden on every lawyer to report all violations, regardless of their nature or kind, whether or not they raised a substantial question as to honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness.”</p>
<p>We now turn to a more in-depth examination of the reporting requirement in Louisiana. At the time the formal charges were filed in this case, Louisiana Rule 8.3(a) provided:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A lawyer possessing unprivileged knowledge of a violation of this code shall report such knowledge to a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon such violation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the rule has three distinct requirements: (1) the lawyer must possess unprivileged knowledge of a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct; (2) the lawyer must report that knowledge; and (3) the report must be made to a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act on the violation. We will discuss each requirement in turn.</p>
<section id="knowledge" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="knowledge">Knowledge</h5>
<p>In its recommendation in this case, the disciplinary board did excellent work in collecting and analyzing the cases and legal commentary interpreting the knowledge requirement of Rule 8.3(a). We need not repeat that analysis here. Considering those authorities, it is clear that absolute certainty of ethical misconduct is not required before the reporting requirement is triggered. The lawyer is not required to conduct an investigation and make a definitive decision that a violation has occurred before reporting; that responsibility belongs to the disciplinary system and this court. On the other hand, knowledge requires more than a mere suspicion of ethical misconduct. We hold that a lawyer will be found to have knowledge of reportable misconduct, and thus reporting is required, where the supporting evidence is such that a reasonable lawyer under the circumstances would form a firm belief that the conduct in question had more likely than not occurred. As such, knowledge is measured by an objective standard that is not tied to the subjective beliefs of the lawyer in question.</p>
</section>
<section id="when-to-report" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-to-report">When to Report</h5>
<p>Once the lawyer decides that a reportable offense has likely occurred, reporting should be made promptly. The need for prompt reporting flows from the need to safeguard the public and the profession against future wrongdoing by the offending lawyer. This purpose is not served unless Rule 8.3(a) is read to require timely reporting under the circumstances presented.</p>
</section>
<section id="appropriate-authority" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appropriate-authority">Appropriate Authority</h5>
<p>Louisiana Rule 8.3(a) requires that the report be made to “a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon such violation.” The term “tribunal or other authority” is not specifically defined. However, as the comments to Model Rule 8.3(a) explain, the report generally should be made to the bar disciplinary authority. Therefore, a report of misconduct by a lawyer admitted to practice in Louisiana must be made to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</p>

<section id="determination-of-respondents-misconduct-and-appropriate-discipline" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="determination-of-respondents-misconduct-and-appropriate-discipline">Determination of Respondent’s Misconduct and Appropriate Discipline</h4>
<p>Applying the principles set forth above to the conduct of respondent in the instant case, we find the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rule 8.3(a). First, we find that respondent should have known that a reportable event occurred at the time of his 1994 barroom conversation with Mr.&nbsp;Deegan. Stated another way, respondent’s conversation with Mr.&nbsp;Deegan at that time gave him sufficient information that a reasonable lawyer under the circumstances would have formed a firm opinion that the conduct in question more likely than not occurred. Regardless of the actual words Mr.&nbsp;Deegan said that night, and whether they were or were not “equivocal,” respondent understood from the conversation that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan had done something wrong. Respondent admitted as much in his affidavit, during the hearing on the motion for new trial in the criminal case, during his sworn statement to the ODC, and during his testimony at the formal hearing. Indeed, during the sworn statement respondent conceded that he would have reported the matter “immediately” were it not for the personal problems he was then experiencing. Respondent also testified that he was surprised and shocked by his friend’s revelation, and that he told him to remedy the situation. There would have been no reason for respondent to react in the manner he did had he not formed a firm opinion that the conduct in question more likely than not occurred. The circumstances under which the conversation took place lend further support to this finding. On the same day that he learned he was dying of cancer, Mr.&nbsp;Deegan felt compelled to tell his best friend about something he had done in a trial that took place nine years earlier. It simply defies logic that respondent would now argue that he could not be sure that Mr.&nbsp;Deegan actually withheld Brady evidence because his statements were vague and non-specific.</p>
<p>We also find that respondent failed to promptly report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct to the disciplinary authorities. As respondent himself acknowledged, he should have reported Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s statements sooner than he did. There was no reason for respondent to have waited five years to tell the ODC about what his friend had done.</p>
<p>In his answer to the formal charges, respondent asserts that he did comply with the reporting requirement of Rule 8.3(a) because he promptly reported Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct to the District Attorney and the Criminal District Court through the attorneys for the criminal defendant, John Thompson. Respondent has misinterpreted Rule 8.3(a) in this regard. The word “tribunal” must be read in the context of the entire sentence in which it appears. The proper inquiry, therefore, is what authority is “empowered” to act upon a charge of attorney misconduct. In Louisiana, only this court possesses the authority to define and regulate the practice of law, including the discipline of attorneys. In turn, we have delegated to disciplinary counsel the authority to investigate and prosecute claims of attorney misconduct. Furthermore, while a trial court bears an independent responsibility to report attorney misconduct to the ODC, only this court may discipline an attorney found guilty of unethical behavior. Therefore, respondent is incorrect in arguing that he discharged his reporting duty under Rule 8.3(a) by reporting Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s misconduct to Mr.&nbsp;Thompson’s attorneys, the District Attorney, and/or the Criminal District Court. It is undisputed that respondent did not report to the appropriate entity, the ODC, until 1999. That report came too late to be construed as “prompt.”</p>
<p>Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an appropriate sanction. In considering that issue, we are mindful that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>Respondent’s actions violated the general duty imposed upon attorneys to maintain and preserve the integrity of the bar. While we adhere to our observation in <em>Brigandi</em> that an attorney’s failure to comply with the reporting requirement is a “serious offense,” in the instant case, we find that respondent’s conduct was merely negligent. Accordingly, Standard 7.3 of the ABA’s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</em> provides that the appropriate baseline sanction is a reprimand.</p>
<p>The only aggravating factor present in this case is respondent’s substantial experience in the practice of law. As for mitigating factors, we adopt those recognized by the disciplinary board, placing particular emphasis on the absence of any dishonest or selfish motive on respondent’s part. Notwithstanding these factors, however, respondent’s failure to report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s bad acts necessitates that some sanction be imposed. Respondent’s knowledge of Mr.&nbsp;Deegan’s conduct was sufficient to impose on him an obligation to promptly report Mr.&nbsp;Deegan to the ODC. Having failed in that obligation, respondent is himself subject to punishment. Under all of the circumstances presented, we conclude that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we will reprimand respondent for his actions.</p>

<p>Respondent, Jack Allen Blakeslee, of Caldwell, Ohio, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1976. In a November 2022 complaint, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Blakeslee with professional misconduct for throwing a feces-filled Pringles can into the parking lot of a victim-advocacy center involved in a capital-murder case in which Blakeslee was representing the defendant. Blakeslee waived a probable-cause determination and, in his answer, admitted many of relator’s factual allegations and the single alleged rule violation. The parties also submitted joint stipulations of fact, misconduct, and aggravating and mitigating factors.</p>
<p>After conducting a hearing, a panel of the Board of Professional Conduct issued a report finding by clear and convincing evidence that Blakeslee had committed the charged misconduct and recommending that we publicly reprimand him for that misconduct. The board adopted the panel’s findings and recommendation. For the reasons that follow, we adopt the board’s finding of misconduct but suspend Blakeslee from the practice of law for one year with six months stayed on the condition that he engage in no further misconduct.</p>
<section id="misconduct-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misconduct-1">MISCONDUCT</h4>
<p>On June 1, 2021, Alexander Wells was indicted in the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas for various offenses, including aggravated murder. The aggravated-murder offense included a specification that the victim was under the age of 13, making it a capital offense.</p>
<p>On June 7, 2021, Blakeslee appeared at Wells’s arraignment and was formally appointed by the court to represent him. Victim advocate Michelle Carpenter Wilkinson, whom had known Blakeslee professionally for many years, also attended Wells’s arraignment. Blakeslee and Carpenter Wilkinson, who serves as chief executive officer of Haven of Hope, a victim-advocacy center in Cambridge, attended several additional court proceedings in the Wells case between June 11 and September 30, 2021.</p>
<p>The trial court scheduled another pretrial hearing in Wells’s case for November 30, 2021, at 8:30 a.m. Before leaving his home on the morning of that hearing, Blakeslee deposited his feces into an empty Pringles can. He then drove approximately 20 minutes from his home in Coal Ridge to Cambridge with the open can of feces. Between 8:10 and 8:15 a.m., Blakeslee turned his vehicle down an alley where the Haven of Hope parking lot is located, approximately two-tenths of a mile from the Guernsey County Common Pleas courthouse. A sign on the building at the entrance to the alley indicated “Haven of Hope Administrative Offices” above a bold arrow pointing down the alley. Surveillance video shows that Blakeslee slowed his vehicle as he initially passed Haven of Hope’s parking lot. He continued driving further down the alley, passing several other parking lots, before turning around. He slowed again as he passed Haven of Hope’s parking lot a second time, threw the Pringles can containing his feces into the lot, and then drove to the courthouse for the 8:30 a.m. pretrial hearing in Wells’s case.</p>
<p>Carpenter Wilkinson saw Blakeslee throw the can out his vehicle toward the Haven of Hope parking lot. After Blakeslee drove away, Carpenter Wilkson approached the item and discovered that it was a Pringles can containing what appeared to be human feces. She then left for the courthouse to attend Wells’s pretrial hearing. Upon arriving at the courthouse, she noticed that Blakeslee was also present for the hearing.</p>
<p>Later that day, after discussing the matter with a prosecutor assigned to the Wells case, Carpenter Wilkinson filed a report with the Cambridge Police Department. Thereafter, Blakeslee was charged with and pleaded guilty to minor-misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and littering. He ultimately paid $248 in fines and court costs for those offenses.</p>
<p>During his disciplinary hearing, Blakeslee testified that he had engaged in similar misconduct on at least ten other occasions that year and that he randomly chose the locations where he deposited the Pringles cans containing his feces. He also specifically denied having any knowledge that the parking lot in question belonged to Haven of Hope when he threw the can from his vehicle on November 30, 2021.</p>
<p>The parties stipulated and the board found that Blakeslee’s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer’s fitness to practice law).</p>
<p>We adopt that finding of misconduct and expressly find that Blakeslee’s conduct adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law even though that conduct is not expressly prohibited by another rule.</p>

<section id="recommended-sanction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommended-sanction">RECOMMENDED SANCTION</h4>
<p>When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider all relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated, the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Gov.Bar R. V(13), and the sanctions imposed in similar cases.</p>
<p>As for aggravating factors, the parties stipulated that Blakeslee had engaged in a pattern of misconduct, presumably based on his admission that he threw feces-filled Pringles cans from his vehicle on at least ten other occasions. The board disagreed, noting that “a ‘pattern of misconduct,’ is typically found where a respondent engages in multiple acts of misconduct, thus forming a pattern.” Finding that this case involved just one rule violation arising from a single incident of misconduct—and that there was no evidence to establish the circumstances surrounding the additional instances of misconduct that Blakeslee had admitted in his testimony—the board rejected the parties’ stipulated aggravating factor. We, however, accept the parties’ stipulation that Blakeslee engaged in a pattern of misconduct. Regardless of whether Blakeslee randomly deposited the additional cans of feces or targeted particular locations or individuals, he freely admitted that he had engaged in similar acts of misconduct on multiple other occasions.</p>
<p>As for mitigating factors, the parties stipulated to the absence of a prior disciplinary record, and the board found that Blakeslee has had a distinguished criminal-defense trial practice for more than four decades with no prior discipline. In addition, the parties stipulated and the board found that Blakeslee also had made full and free disclosure to the board and demonstrated a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, presented evidence of his good character and reputation, and had other penalties and sanctions imposed for his misconduct—namely, the nominal fines and court costs imposed for his misdemeanor convictions. The board also found that neither Wells nor Carpenter Wilkinson had been harmed by Blakeslee’s actions.</p>
<p>In addition, the board found that Blakeslee had accepted full responsibility for his actions, expressed genuine remorse, and testified that he is no longer engaging in the misconduct. Although Blakeslee testified that he was a Vietnam veteran and that he had received psychological treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) related to his military service as well as child abuse, he did not seek to establish his disorder as a mitigating factor under Gov.Bar R. V(13)(C)(7).</p>
<p>Blakeslee has described his misconduct as a “prank” and admitted that it was “stupid.” He also acknowledged that he was embarrassed by the public revelation of his misconduct and the resulting media attention.</p>
<p>Relator took the position that Blakeslee deposited the can of feces in the Haven of Hope parking lot with the intent of targeting Haven of Hope. In support of this position, relator relied on circumstantial evidence, including Blakeslee’s 20-minute drive, the sign pointing toward access to Haven of Hope’s office, Blakeslee’s slow drive down the alley, and the fact that he went to court immediately after he deposited the can of feces to attend a hearing in the Wells case where Carpenter Wilkinson would be present. However, Blakeslee denied having any knowledge of Haven of Hope’s location on November 30, 2021, and maintained that he had chosen all the locations for his deposits at random. The hearing panel and the board found Blakeslee’s testimony to be credible and concluded that relator’s position was not supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p>During closing argument, relator argued that Blakeslee’s misconduct warrants a conditionally stayed six-month suspension whereas Blakeslee suggested that a public reprimand would be appropriate. Both parties acknowledged that very few, if any, prior cases offer guidance regarding the appropriate sanction for the misconduct at issue here.</p>
<p>Relying primarily on <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Linnen,</em> 2006 Ohio 5480 (2006), <em>Butler Cty. Bar Assn. v. Blauvelt,</em> 2020 Ohio 3325 (2020), and the precept that the primary purpose of the disciplinary sanction is not to punish the offender but to protect the public, the board recommends that we publicly reprimand Blakeslee for his misconduct.</p>
<p>Over a period of nearly two years, Linnen approached at least 30 different women throughout Franklin County wearing only athletic shoes and a stocking cap and photographed their reactions. He admitted that he would sometimes tap or pinch a victim’s rear end to get her attention and that he may have masturbated in front of his first couple of victims. Linnen pleaded guilty to 53 misdemeanor offenses—two first-degree misdemeanor counts of sexual imposition, one first-degree misdemeanor count of aggravated trespass, 11 third-degree misdemeanor counts of sexual imposition, and 39 fourth-degree misdemeanor counts of public indecency. He was sentenced to 18 months of work release, fined $3,000, and ordered to continue counseling. We found that Linnen violated professional-conduct rules prohibiting attorneys from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude and conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer’s fitness to practice.</p>
<p>In aggravation, we found that Linnen had engaged in a pattern of misconduct involving multiple offenses and that he had acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, the latter finding based on his testimony that the impetus for his crimes was “definitely an adrenaline rush or euphoria very much like a powerful drug.” We also found that Linnen had failed to genuinely acknowledge the wrongful nature of his misconduct, focusing primarily on his own embarrassment and hardship rather than the harm he had caused to his victims. In mitigation, Linnen had no prior disciplinary record, had cooperated completely in the disciplinary process, and had presented evidence of his good character. We indefinitely suspended him for his misconduct.</p>
<p>In <em>Blauvelt,</em> the attorney was twice caught driving naked. The first time, he was stopped for a headlight violation and the officer observed he was naked but filed no charges against him. The second time, after receiving a report that a motorist was masturbating while driving, a state trooper stopped Blauvelt’s vehicle and found him naked with pants covering his lap. Blauvelt was charged with public indecency and operating a vehicle while under the influence; he later pleaded guilty to public indecency and an amended charge of reckless operation of a vehicle. He was sentenced to suspended jail terms and ordered to pay fines, complete a driver-intervention program, and serve a one-year term of nonreporting probation.</p>
<p>During Blauvelt’s disciplinary proceedings, he acknowledged that he had driven while naked on other occasions without getting caught. Aggravating factors consisted of a pattern of misconduct and submitting a false statement during a psychological evaluation conducted as part of the disciplinary process. In mitigation, Blauvelt had a clean disciplinary record and had had a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, submitted evidence of his good character and reputation, and had other penalties imposed for some of his misconduct. And in contrast to Linnen, Blauvelt expressed sincere remorse for his conduct, established the existence of a qualifying mental disorder, and did not appear to have targeted anyone with his conduct. We imposed a two-year suspension, stayed in its entirety on conditions focused on mental-health treatment, for Blauvelt’s misconduct. We later indefinitely suspended Blauvelt for continuing to engage in similar acts of misconduct.</p>
<p>Here, the board found that Blakeslee’s misconduct was less egregious than that of Blauvelt, in part because Blakeslee did not act with a sexual motivation. It also noted that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma recently disbarred an attorney who, among numerous other substantial violations, had issued to a client a refund check that was soiled with feces. <em>See</em> <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Assn. v. Bailey</em>, 2023 OK 34 (2023). The court found that whether Bailey’s delivery of a soiled check was an intentional or an unintentional act, his conduct “is contrary to prescribed standards of conduct in our society where people recognize the potential harm from exposure to fecal matter, and also view its transfer from one to another as criminal in some circumstances.” The court determined that Bailey’s delivery of the soiled check had been discussed in the media and brought discredit to the legal profession. It therefore concluded that Bailey violated Rule 1.3 of the Oklahoma Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings, which provides that an attorney should not “act contrary to prescribed standards of conduct” when the act “would reasonably be found to bring discredit upon the legal profession.”</p>
<p>Ohio has no comparable rule. However, the evidence in this case shows that despite societal standards of cleanliness and decorum, Blakeslee failed to control his own bizarre impulses to place feces-filled cans out in public for unsuspecting people to find. His aberrant conduct has adversely reflected on his own fitness to practice law and brought discredit to the profession through significant media attention.</p>
<p>We typically defer to a hearing panel’s credibility determinations unless the record weighs heavily against those findings, inasmuch as the panel members had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses firsthand. Although Blakeslee testified that he randomly selected all the locations in which he deposited his feces-filled cans, the circumstantial evidence in the record weighs heavily against his testimony that he randomly chose the Haven of Hope parking lot as his drop zone on November 30, 2021.</p>
<p>The board found that Blakeslee had known Carpenter Wilkinson professionally for many years. In fact, Blakeslee testified that he had known her for 20 years and that she had been a victim’s advocate at Haven of Hope for as long as he had known her. In addition to their association through Haven of Hope, Blakeslee stated that he and Carpenter Wilkinson were friends on Facebook and that he had represented her daughter in a legal matter. He also testified that he knew everyone at Haven of Hope and indicated, during his deposition testimony, that he “dealt with them on a daily basis.” Despite his close and long-term working relationship with Carpenter Wilkinson and her colleagues, Blakeslee maintained that he had had no knowledge of where their administrative office was located.</p>
<p>In his deposition testimony, Blakeslee claimed that “it was an indiscriminate choice,” that he “had no plans to throw that thing in Cambridge” that morning, and that “it just so happened that he did.” He also claimed, “I didn’t pick the spot. It was just on the way down that alley.” But at his disciplinary hearing, he testified that when he engages in this behavior, he routinely disposes of the can “on the way to work.”</p>
<p>On the day in question, Blakeslee was headed to the Guernsey County courthouse for Wells’s hearing. He was likely to see Carpenter Wilkinson there because she had attended most of the previous hearings in that case. He drove for approximately 20 minutes from his home to Cambridge with the open can of feces in his car without previously disposing of the can somewhere else.</p>
<p>Blakeslee can be seen on surveillance video turning his vehicle down the alley where Haven of Hope’s administrative office is located, approximately two-tenths of a mile from the courthouse. Video from other cameras in the alley show him slow down as he passed the Haven of Hope parking lot and then speed up. The video also shows him turn around in another parking lot to take a second pass down the alley in the opposite direction. Once again, he slowed his car as he passed the Haven of Hope parking lot—only that time, he tossed the Pringles can out the window before speeding up and driving away. Another video shows Blakeslee exiting the alley at approximately 8:14 a.m. and driving toward the courthouse. Video from the courthouse shows him entering the building just a few minutes later.</p>
<p>Although Blakeslee claimed that he had “no specific targets” and engaged in “random incidents” when previously engaging in this type of misconduct, he also stated that before this incident, he usually would throw the can in the street. He explained during his deposition and hearing testimony that he threw the feces-filled cans “to blow off steam” and that he “got a kick out of it,” imagining the “look of surprise” on peoples’ faces when they would find them. Blakeslee’s statement that “it was kind of like a release” suggests that like Linnen, he engaged in aberrant conduct to seek an adrenaline rush or thrill.</p>
<p>These facts weigh heavily against Blakeslee’s testimony that the location of his November 30, 2021 deposit was random or coincidental. Rather, they present clear and convincing evidence not only that he intentionally selected that location but also that he escalated a preexisting pattern of conduct to seek an even greater thrill by pulling his prank on someone he knew—be it Carpenter Wilkinson or one of her colleagues—just minutes before he would see one of them in court. Although Blakeslee maintained throughout his disciplinary proceeding that his misconduct had nothing to do with his PTSD, he agreed during his deposition that the misconduct was not normal and stated, “There has to be something going on that’s related to some of the things I went through in early life.” And during his disciplinary hearing, he suggested that his misconduct may be a “protest of some kind.” But when asked what he was protesting, he responded somewhat evasively, stating, “Well, we all protest something.”</p>
<p>In this case—as in <em>Blauvelt</em> and <em>Linnen</em> before it—we are dealing with admittedly bizarre behavior that falls far short of the standard of conduct expected of lawyers and tends to bring the legal profession into disrepute. Each of the three cases presents unique facts. <em>Linnen</em> involved criminal conduct that consisted of accosting numerous female victims (sometimes touching them) and violating them by photographing their reactions to his indecent exposure. Blauvelt’s conduct, while inappropriate and disreputable, did not target particular victims or cause them harm. Because we find that Blakeslee’s misconduct was directed at Carpenter Wilkinson and her colleagues, we also find that it has implicated his professional life in a way that neither Blauvelt’s nor Linnen’s did. And for those reasons, we find that the severity of Blakeslee’s misconduct falls somewhere between that of Blauvelt and Linnen.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that Blakeslee does not appear to have harbored any animosity toward Carpenter Wilkinson, her colleagues, or their work as victim’s advocates. Nor did he intend to intimidate them. While the record demonstrates that Blakeslee regrets his misconduct, it also shows that he lacks sufficient insight into the origin of and motivation for his inappropriate behavior to effectuate positive change. We therefore reject the board’s assessment that there is no factual basis for concluding that the public needs to be protected from additional violations, and we conclude that the appropriate sanction for Blakeslee’s misconduct is a one-year suspension with six months stayed on the condition that he engage in no further misconduct.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>Accordingly, Jack Allen Blakeslee is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year with six months stayed on the condition that he engage in no further misconduct. If Blakeslee fails to comply with the condition of the stay, the stay will be lifted and he will serve the entire one-year suspension. Costs are taxed to Blakeslee.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The NC Board of Law Examiners has also issued <a href="https://www.ncble.org/character-and-fitness-guidelines">Character &amp; Fitness Guidelines</a> elaborating on the standard:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Every applicant shall have the burden of proving that the applicant possesses the qualifications of character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law, and is possessed of good moral character and is entitled to the high regard and confidence of the public.</p>
<p>The term “good moral character”, includes but is not limited to the qualities of honesty, fairness, candor, trustworthiness, observance of fiduciary and personal responsibility and of the laws of North Carolina and of the United States and a respect for the rights and property of other persons. The term “fitness” includes but is not limited to, the mental or emotional stability of the applicant to practice law in North Carolina.</p>
<p>In satisfying the requirements of good moral character and fitness, applicants should be persons whose record of conduct justifies the trust of clients, adversaries, courts and others with respect to the professional duties owed to them and whose record demonstrates the qualities of honesty, trustworthiness, diligence, responsibility and reliability.</p>
<p>The revelation or discovery of any of the following may be treated as cause for further inquiry before the Board decides whether the applicant possesses the requisite character and fitness to practice law. The foregoing is inclusive of but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Unlawful conduct</p></li>
<li><p>Academic misconduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Making or procuring any false or misleading statement or omission of relevant information including any false or misleading statement or omission on the application for admission to a college or university, a law school, or to the North Carolina Bar or any amendment or in any testimony or any sworn statement submitted to the Board.</p></li>
<li><p>Misconduct in employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Acts involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Abuse of legal process.</p></li>
<li><p>Neglect of financial responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Neglect of professional obligations.</p></li>
<li><p>Violation of an order of a Court, including failure to pay child support.</p></li>
<li><p>Military Misconduct. A discharge other than honorable.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence of current mental or emotional impairment.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence of drug or alcohol misuse, abuse or dependency.</p></li>
<li><p>Denial of admission to the Bar in any other jurisdiction on character and fitness grounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Disciplinary action by a lawyer, disciplinary agency, or other professional disciplinary agency of any jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Any other conduct which reflects adversely upon the character or fitness of the applicant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>A. Unlawful conduct:</em></p>
<p>North Carolina allows an applicant to omit reference to any arrest, charge or conviction that has been expunged by a duly entered order of expunction pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes of North Carolina. For any offenses that have not been expunged as outlined above, the Board may inquire into arrests even if no conviction resulted. There are many reasons why arrests do not result in convictions, and many of them have no bearing on guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>Other than offenses that have been expunged as outlined above, the Board is authorized to inquire into all areas of possibly relevant applicant misconduct. The applicant is required to report such incidents, and to provide evidence of rehabilitation, if relevant, and evidence of current good character. The occurrence of an acquittal or dismissal is relevant but is not dispositive of the issue. This is not to suggest that the Board will assume that any arrest was due to guilty conduct on the part of an applicant. The applicant’s obligation is to be completely forthright regarding all matters about which the Board inquires.</p>
<p>If, at the time of the application, criminal charges are pending against the applicant, the Board will table the application until these charges are resolved. If a conviction results in probation, restitution or some other sentence, the Board will not consider the application until the sentence has been served and probation completed. The Board will then proceed to investigate the facts and circumstances that led to the criminal charges.</p>
<p><em>B. Making a false statement:</em></p>
<p>Dishonesty in dealings with employers, schools (including applications for admission) and authorities, including the Board of Law Examiners, is grounds for denial of bar applications. Giving false information on the application or failing to be entirely forthcoming and completely candid in the application process is a serious error which will have negative consequences for an applicant. With respect to non-disclosure on the law school application the Board will require at a minimum evidence that the applicant has made full disclosure of the erroneous or omitted information to the law school administration together with the action if any taken by the law school.</p>
<p><em>C. Neglect of financial responsibilities:</em></p>
<p>The Board recognizes that mishandling of client funds is a frequent and serious cause for professional discipline. While admission to the bar does not require a perfect credit record, the Board is interested in whether applicants have dealt honestly and responsibly with their creditors, and whether they are doing so at the time of application.</p>
<p>Responsible dealings generally include but are not limited to keeping in contact with the creditor, making payment arrangements, and meeting the terms of those arrangements. If the applicant currently has unpaid collections, judgments, liens, or charged off accounts, in the absence of unusual mitigating circumstances, the Board considers it important that the applicant demonstrate several months payments as agreed to show a good faith effort to clear the debts.</p>
<p>If an applicant has defaulted student loans, the Board may in its discretion hold the application in abeyance until the applicant has made arrangements with the lender(s) for repayment of the loan(s) and has made several months of consecutive and uninterrupted monthly payments pursuant to the plan agreed to by the lender(s). Any arrearage in child support must be paid before an applicant will be certified by the Board.</p>
<p><em>D. Evidence of current mental impairment:</em></p>
<p>Evidence of current mental impairment, including evidence of impairment due to psychiatric conditions, is one of the factors about which the Board must inquire in determining the applicant’s fitness to practice law. Board members recognize that the stresses of law school, as well as other life factors, frequently result in applicants seeking psychiatric or psychological counseling. The Board encourages any applicant to obtain such counseling or treatment if needed. The applicant should not allow the bar application process to deter them from obtaining treatment or counseling. Applicants should be aware that the Board looks favorably on applicants’ self-recognition of their need for treatment and appropriate utilization of professional services.</p>
<p><em>E. Drug or alcohol dependency:</em></p>
<p>Evidence of impairment due to drug or alcohol dependence or abuse is a factor that must be considered by the Board in determining the applicant’s fitness to practice law. The applicant should be prepared to provide treatment records as well as other records of incidents which were associated with any impairment. The Board may require applicants to obtain a drug or alcohol evaluation from a licensed professional recommended by the Board.</p>
<p>An applicant who has a problem with drugs or alcohol is strongly encouraged to get the counseling or treatment needed as soon as possible. If the applicant has been impaired due to chemical dependency or abuse, the applicant’s recognition of the problem and the treatment record will be important positive evidence of rehabilitation, regardless of the seriousness of any misconduct which may have arisen from the chemical dependency.</p>
<p><em>F. Evidence of Rehabilitation:</em></p>
<p>The Board shall determine whether the character and fitness of an applicant qualify the applicant to take the North Carolina Bar Examination or to be admitted by comity. In making this determination, the following factors should be considered in assigning weight and significance to prior conduct:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The applicant’s age at the time of the conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The recency of the conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The reliability of the information concerning the conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The seriousness of the conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The factors underlying the conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The cumulative effect of the conduct or information.</p></li>
<li><p>The applicant’s candor in the admissions process.</p></li>
<li><p>The materiality of any omissions or misrepresentations.</p></li>
<li><p>The evidence of rehabilitation and the applicant’s positive social contributions since the conduct.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence of rehabilitation is one of the main factors the Board uses to determine whether past problems should lead to denial of an application. Under Rule .0601 of the Board’s Rules, every applicant has the burden of proving that the applicant possesses the qualifications of character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law and is possessed of such good moral character as to be entitled to the high regard and confidence of the public.</p>
<p>An applicant who asserts rehabilitation from prior misconduct which bears adversely upon the applicant’s character and fitness shall be required to produce clear and convincing evidence of such rehabilitation, which may include but are not limited to the following elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Absence of recent misconduct</p></li>
<li><p>Strict compliance with the specific conditions of any disciplinary, judicial, administrative or other order, where applicable</p></li>
<li><p>Impeccable character and moral standing in the community</p></li>
<li><p>Good reputation for professional ability, where applicable</p></li>
<li><p>Sufficiency of the punishment including payment of fines and restitution made; including the restitution of funds or property, where applicable</p></li>
<li><p>Applicant’s current attitude about prior offenses (acceptance of responsibility and renunciation of past wrongdoing and remorse)</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of malice and ill feeling toward those who by duty were compelled to bring about the disciplinary, judicial, administrative or other proceeding</p></li>
<li><p>Personal assurances, supported by corroborating evidence, of a desire and intention to conduct one’s self in an exemplary fashion in the future</p></li>
<li><p>Applicant’s constructive activities and accomplishments subsequent to the criminal conviction</p></li>
<li><p>Applicant’s candor, sincerity and full disclosure in character and fitness proceedings</p></li>
<li><p>Positive actions beyond those one would do for self-benefit including but not limited to working as a guardian ad litem, volunteering on a regular basis with shelters for the homeless or victims of domestic violence or maintaining substantial involvement in other charitable, community or educational organizations whose value system, overall mission and activities are directed to good deeds and humanitarian concerns impacting a broad base of citizens</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstration of the applicant’s understanding of the responsibility to the administration of justice and the practice of law</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Merely showing that an individual is now living as and doing those things that this person should have done throughout life, although necessary to prove rehabilitation, does not prove that the individual has undertaken a useful and constructive place in society. The requirement of a positive action is appropriate for applicants for admission to the bar because service to one’s community is an implied obligation to members of the Bar.</p>
<p>The Board will not consider witness testimony or evidence offered by a witness in support of the applicant on any issue listed above unless the witness has been fully informed of the misconduct before offering the evidence.</p>

<p>Paul Raymond Converse appeals a decision of the Nebraska State Bar Commission (Commission) denying his request to take the July 1998 Nebraska bar examination. Converse claims that the decision of the Commission should be reversed because the Commission rested its denial of Converse’s application, at least in part, upon conduct protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and, in the alternative, that Converse’s conduct did not constitute sufficient cause under Nebraska law for denying his application on the ground of deficient moral character. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the Commission.</p>
<section id="factual-background" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="factual-background">Factual Background</h4>
<p>In 1998, Converse applied for permission to sit for the Nebraska bar examination. On June 29, 1998, Converse was notified by letter that the Commission had denied permission for him to take the July 1998 Nebraska bar examination because it had determined that Converse lacked the requisite moral character for admission upon examination to the Nebraska State Bar Association. On July 7, the Commission received notice that Converse was appealing the Commission’s initial determination. Converse’s appeal was heard on September 15, after which the Commission reaffirmed its initial determination and notified Converse on December 18 that he would not be allowed to sit for the Nebraska bar examination at that time.</p>
<p>The evidence at the Commission hearing revealed that as part of the application process, Converse was required to request that the dean of his law school submit a form certifying completion of Converse’s law school studies. That form contained a question asking, “Is there anything concerning this applicant about which the Bar Examiners should further inquire regarding the applicant’s moral character of fitness to practice law?” The question was answered, “Yes,” and the dean also noted, “Additional information will be provided upon request.” The Commission followed up on this notation by conducting an investigation which ultimately revealed certain facts regarding Converse.</p>
<p>After the completion of his first semester at the University of South Dakota (USD) Law School, Converse sent a letter to then assistant dean Diane May regarding certain issues—not relevant to this appeal—that he had had with the law school during fall classes, closing that letter with the phrase, “Hope you get a full body tan in Costa Rica.” Subsequent to that note, Converse had several more encounters with May, beginning with his writing letters to May about receiving grades lower than what he believed he had earned in an appellate advocacy class.</p>
<p>After he received a grade he believed to be unjustified by his performance in the appellate advocacy course, Converse wrote letters to May and to the USD law school dean, Barry Vickrey, requesting assistance with an appeal of that grade. In addition to writing letters to Vickrey and May, Converse also sent a letter to the South Dakota Supreme Court regarding the appellate advocacy course professor’s characterization of his arguments, with indications that carbon copies of the letter were sent to two well-known federal court of appeals judges. The letter was written to suggest the professor believed her stance on certain issues was more enlightened than that of the judges. Converse sent numerous correspondence to various people regarding the grade appeal against the specific professor. Despite all such correspondence, Converse testified at the hearing that no formal appeal of the grievance was ever filed. Converse’s grade was never adjusted.</p>
<p>The evidence showed that following the grade “appeal,” Converse prepared a memorandum and submitted it to his classmates, urging them to recall an “incident” in which yet another professor lashed out at him in class, and to be cognizant of the image that incident casts “on [that professor’s] core professionalism” prior to completing class evaluations. Converse also wrote a letter to a newspaper in South Dakota, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, regarding a proposed fee increase at the USD law school. Converse immediately began investigating the salaries of USD law professors and posted a list of selected professors’ salaries on the student bulletin board, as well as writing a letter that accused Vickrey of trying to pull a “fast one.”</p>
<p>Converse’s next altercation at the USD law school involved a photograph of a nude female’s backside that he displayed in his study carrel in the USD law library. The picture was removed by a law librarian. In response to the removal of this photograph, Converse contacted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and received a letter indicating that his photograph might be a protected expression under the First Amendment. Once again, Converse went to the student newspaper to alert the student body of the actions of the law school authorities, accusing them of unconstitutional censorship.</p>
<p>Converse redisplayed the photograph once it was returned by the law librarians. Vickrey received several complaints about the photograph from other students, classifying Converse’s behavior as “unprofessional and inappropriate.” Upon Converse’s redisplay of the photograph, Vickrey sent him a memorandum explaining that the picture would not be removed only because Vickrey did not want to involve the school in controversy during final examinations. Converse testified that he redisplayed the photograph in order to force the alleged constitutional issue.</p>
<p>The evidence also revealed that Converse filed an ethics complaint with the North Dakota Bar Association regarding certain correspondence between Vickrey and a retired justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court. The complaint was dismissed. Converse went to the USD student newspaper, claiming that a letter from a retired North Dakota justice to the ACLU, in response to questions from Vickrey, was a violation of professional ethics (apparently Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 4.2 (1999), which precludes a lawyer from discussing matters with opposing parties the lawyer knows to be represented by counsel). In addition to going to the press, Converse also contacted the president of USD, referring to Vickrey as an “incompetent” and requesting that Vickrey be fired. In addition to this incident, Converse reported his suspicions about USD’s student health insurance policy to the student newspaper under the title of “Law Student Suspects Health Insurance Fraud,” as well as in a separate article alleging that USD had suppressed an investigation of its insurance carrier.</p>
<p>The Commission also heard testimony regarding Converse’s attempt to obtain an internship with the U.S. Attorney’s office in South Dakota. Converse arranged for the internship on his own, only to have his request subsequently rejected by the law school. Upon receiving his denial, Converse sent a complaint to all of USD’s law school faculty members. Vickrey testified that Converse’s internship was rejected because he failed to comply with the law school’s procedures regarding internships. Converse then contacted the chairperson of the law school committee of the South Dakota State Bar Association with his complaint, expressly referring to Vickrey as being “arrogant.” There is no indication of a response from the chairperson in the record.</p>
<p>The issue next considered by the Commission was that of various litigation threatened by Converse. Converse indicated that he would “likely” be filing a lawsuit against Vickrey for violations of his First Amendment rights. Converse was also involved in a dispute with other law students, in which he threatened to file a lawsuit and warned the students that all lawsuits in which they were involved would need to be reported to proper authorities when they applied to take a bar examination. Further, Converse posted signs on the bulletin board at the law school denouncing a professor, in response to the way in which Converse’s parking appeal was handled, and then went to the student newspaper to criticize the process and those involved in that appeal.</p>
<p>One of the final issues addressed by the Commission in its hearing was that of a T-shirt Converse produced and marketed on which a nude caricature of Vickrey is shown sitting astride what appears to be a large hot dog. The cartoon on the shirt also contains the phrase “Astride the Peter Principle,” which Converse claims connotes the principle that Vickrey had been promoted past his level of competence; however, Converse admits that the T-shirt could be construed to have certain sexual overtones. Converse admitted that the creation of this T-shirt would not be acceptable behavior for a lawyer.</p>
<p>In response to not being allowed to post signs and fliers at the law school, Converse sent a memo to all law students in which he noted to his fellow students that his “Deanie on a Weanie” T-shirts were in stock. In that same memo, Converse included a note to his schoolmates:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So far 4 causes of action have arisen, courtesy Tricky Vickrey. [He then listed what he believed the causes of action to be.] When you pass the SD Bar, if you want to earn some atty [sic] fees, get hold of me and we can go for one of these. I’ve kept evidence, of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vickrey asked Converse not to wear his T-shirt to his graduation ceremony, and Converse decided that “it would be a better choice in his life not to go to that commencement.” Converse acknowledges that Vickrey’s request was made in a civil manner.</p>
<p>The evidence also revealed that prior to law school, Converse, in his capacity as a landlord, sued a tenant for nonpayment of rent and referred to the tenant as a “fucking welfare bitch.” At the hearing, in response to questioning from the Commission, Converse testified at great length as to how he tends to personally attack individuals when he finds himself embroiled in a controversy.</p>
<p>After the Commission notified Converse that he would not be allowed to sit for the Nebraska bar examination, Converse appealed the adverse determination to this court.</p>
</section>
<section id="assignments-of-error" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assignments-of-error">Assignments of Error</h4>
<p>Converse claims that the Commission erred in basing its decision, in part, upon conduct and speech arguably protected by the First Amendment; not making Converse aware of all of the “charges” against him in the proceedings in violation of the 14th Amendment; and determining that Converse’s conduct gave rise to sufficient cause under Nebraska law for the Commission to deny his application to sit for the Nebraska bar examination.</p>
</section>
<section id="analysis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h4>
<p>Converse first assigns as error that the Commission’s determination should not stand because it is based in large part upon speech that is protected by the First Amendment. Thus, the threshold question we must answer is whether conduct arguably protected by the First Amendment can be considered by the Commission during an investigation into an applicant’s moral character and fitness to practice law. We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>
<p>There are four U.S. Supreme Court cases that provide particular guidance with respect to this issue. In <em>Konigsberg v. State Bar,</em> 366 U.S. 36 (1961), the bar applicant argued that when the California bar commission forced him to either answer questions about his affiliation with the Communist Party or to face the repercussions of not being certified as possessing the required moral character to sit for the bar, the commission violated his First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court disagreed, pointing out that “regulatory statutes, not intended to control the content of speech but incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise, have not been regarded as the type of law the First or Fourteenth Amendment forbids when they have been found justified by subordinating valid governmental interests.” In the context of a character inquiry, “it is difficult, indeed, to imagine a view of the constitutional protections of speech and association which would automatically exclude all reference to prior speech or association on such issues as character, purpose, credibility, or intent.” The Court balanced the effect of allowing such questions against the need for the state to do a complete inquiry into the character of an applicant and concluded that questions about membership would not chill association to the extent of harm caused by striking down the screening process. The Court held that requiring the applicant to answer the questions was not an infringement of the applicant’s First Amendments rights.</p>
<p>In 1971, the Court was once again confronted with the issue and decided a trilogy of cases concerning the bar admissions procedures of various states. It was the final case in this trilogy, <em>Law Students Research Council v. Wadmond</em>, that clarified the law as to the appropriate depth of a state bar commission’s inquiry on an applicant’s moral character. The Court declined to uphold a First Amendment attack against the admission procedure of the New York bar association. The Court upheld the statute, which required that the admitting authority be “‘satisfied that [the applicant] possesses the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counsellor-at-law.’” The Court declared that a state is constitutionally entitled to make such an inquiry of an applicant for admission to the bar and placed its imprimatur upon a state’s conducting a preliminary inquiry into the moral character of those seeking admission.</p>
<p>Converse conceded at oral argument that the Commission’s decision cannot be based solely on an applicant’s exercise of First Amendment freedoms but that it is proper for the Commission to go behind the exercise of those freedoms and consider an applicant’s moral character. That is exactly what was done by the Commission in the instant case. An investigation of Converse’s moral character is not a proceeding in which the applicant is being prosecuted for conduct arguably protected by the First Amendment, but, rather, “an investigation of the conduct of [an applicant] for the purpose of determining whether he shall be admitted.” Converse’s reliance upon cases where a judgment was invalidated at least in part because it was based on conduct protected by the First Amendment is therefore misplaced.</p>
<p>Were we to adopt the position asserted by Converse in this case, the Commission would be limited to conducting only cursory investigations of an applicant’s moral character and past conduct. Justice Potter Stewart, writing for the majority in <em>Law Students Research Council v. Wadmond</em>, noted that the implications of such an attack on a bar screening process are that no screening process would be constitutionally permissible beyond academic examination and an extremely minimal check for serious, concrete character deficiencies. “The principle means of policing the Bar would then be the deterrent and punitive effects of such post-admission sanctions as contempt, disbarment, malpractice suits, and criminal prosecutions.” Assuming but not deciding that Converse’s conduct may have been protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, <em>Law Students Research Council v. Wadmond</em> makes clear that a bar commission is allowed to consider speech and conduct in making determinations of an applicant’s character, and that is precisely what has occurred in the instant case. As aptly stated by the South Dakota Supreme Court in <em>In re Egan,</em> 24 S.D. 301 (1909):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There can be such an abuse of the freedom of speech and liberty of the press as to show that a party is not possessed “of good moral character,” as required for admission to the bar of this state and therefore to require that such person be excluded from the bar of this state; and to our mind the evidence submitted here shows such an instance. “Nor can the respondent be justified on the ground of guaranteed liberty of speech. When a man enters upon a campaign of villification, he takes his fate into his own hands, and must expect to be held to answer for the abuse of the privilege extended to him by the Constitution.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We conclude that the Commission properly considered Converse’s conduct as it reflects upon his moral character, even if such conduct might have been protected by the First Amendment. Converse’s first assignment of error is therefore without merit.</p>
<p>Converse next contends that the Commission violated his due process rights by not making him aware of all of the “charges” against him in these proceedings. This argument is basically that when the Commission determined that he lacked the requisite moral character and gave some examples as to why they reached such a determination, they should have provided an all-inclusive list delineating every reason on which their decision was based. We conclude that such a procedure is not required.</p>
<p>By alleging that he has not been made fully aware of the “charges” against him, Converse has confused this inquiry into his moral character with a trial. Such is not the case. An inquiry regarding an application to the bar is not a lawsuit with the formalities of a trial, but, rather, is an investigation of the conduct of an applicant for membership to the bar for the purpose of determining whether he shall be admitted. No charges have been filed against Converse, and he has been advised of the reasons for which his application was denied. Converse’s assignment of error that he has been denied due process of law is therefore without merit.</p>
<p>Converse’s third assignment of error alleges that the Commission erred by determining there was sufficient cause to deny his application to sit for the Nebraska bar exam. Much of his argument centers around his conduct being protected by the First Amendment, as discussed previously. However, the question presented is not the scope of Converse’s rights under the First Amendment, but whether Converse’s propensity to unreasonably react against anyone whom he believes opposes him reveals his lack of professional responsibility, which renders him unfit to practice law.</p>
<p>There is no question that “a state can require high standards of qualification, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar.” The Court has also stated that it must be “kept clearly in mind that an applicant for admission to the bar bears the burden of proof of ‘good moral character’—a requirement whose validity is not, nor could well be, drawn in question here.” “If at the conclusion of the proceedings the evidence of good character and that of bad character are found in even balance, the State may refuse admission.” Nebraska does, in fact, require a bar applicant to show that the applicant is of good moral character. Therefore, the burden is upon Converse to adequately prove his fitness to practice law in Nebraska, and the evidence will be viewed in this light.</p>
<p>The legal reality is that this court, and only this court, is vested with the power to admit persons to the practice of law in this state and to fix qualifications for admission to the Nebraska bar. With that in mind, we commence our analysis with the standards for moral character required for admission to the Nebraska bar as set out in our rules governing the admission of attorneys. Neb. Ct. R. for Adm. of Attys. 3 governs this situation, which provides in pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An attorney should be one whose record of conduct justifies the trust of clients, adversaries, courts, and others with respect to the professional duties owed to them. A record manifesting a significant deficiency by an applicant in one or more of the following essential eligibility requirements for the practice of law may constitute a basis for denial of admission. In addition to the admission requirements otherwise established by these Rules, the essential eligibility requirements for admission to the practice of law in Nebraska are:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(a) The ability to conduct oneself with a high degree of honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness in all professional relationships and with respect to all legal obligations;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(c) The ability to conduct oneself with respect for and in accordance with the law and the Code of Professional Responsibility;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(j) The ability to conduct oneself professionally and in a manner that engenders respect for the law and the profession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under rule 3, Converse must prove that his past conduct is in conformity with the standards set forth by this court, and the record in this case compels the conclusion that he has failed to do so.</p>
<p>We considered an appeal of a similarly situated bar applicant in <em>In re Appeal of Lane,</em> 249 Neb. 499 (1996). <em>In re Appeal of Lane</em> involved an individual seeking readmission to the Nebraska bar whose past included confrontations with law school faculty, the use of strong and profane language with fellow students at his bar review course, the use of intimidating and rude conduct directed at a security guard at the place where he was taking his bar review course, and some controversial interactions with females. We held that, taken together, “these incidents show that Lane is prone to turbulence, intemperance, and irresponsibility, characteristics which are not acceptable in one who would be a counselor and advocate in the legal system,” and we upheld the denial of his application.</p>
<p>We explained in <em>In re Appeal of Lane</em> that the “requisite restraint in dealing with others is <em>obligatory conduct for attorneys</em> because ‘the efficient and orderly administration of justice cannot be successfully carried on if we allow attorneys to engage in unwarranted attacks on the court or opposing counsel. Such tactics seriously lower the public respect for the Bar.’” Furthermore, “‘an attorney who exhibits a lack of civility, good manners and common courtesy tarnishes the image of the bar.’” We held in <em>In re Appeal of Lane</em> that “abusive, disruptive, hostile, intemperate, intimidating, irresponsible, threatening, or turbulent behavior is a proper basis for the denial of admission to the bar.” Expanding on this holding, we stated:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Care with words and respect for courts and one’s adversaries is a necessity, not because lawyers and judges are without fault, but because trial by combat long ago proved unsatisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The profession’s insistence that counsel show restraint, self-discipline and a sense of reality in dealing with courts, other counsel, witnesses and adversaries is more than insistence on good manners. It is based on the knowledge that civilized, rational behavior is essential if the judicial system is to perform its function. Absent this, any judicial proceeding is likely to degenerate into a verbal free-for-all. Habitual unreasonable reaction to adverse rulings is conduct of a type not to be permitted of a lawyer when acting as a lawyer. <em>What cannot be permitted in lawyers, cannot be tolerated in those applying for admission as lawyers.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Nebraska, <em>In re Appeal of Lane</em> is clearly the rule and not an exception thereto.</p>
<p>The evidence in this case shows that Converse’s numerous disputes and personal attacks indicate a “pattern and a way of life which appear to be [Converse’s] normal reaction to opposition and disappointment.” The totality of the evidence clearly establishes that Converse possesses an inclination to personally attack those with whom he has disputes. Such inclinations “are not acceptable in one who would be a counselor and advocate in the legal system.”</p>
<p>In addition to Converse’s tendency to personally attack those individuals with whom he has disputes, his pattern of behavior indicates an additional tendency to do so in arenas other than those specifically established within the legal system. This tendency is best exemplified by observing Converse’s conduct in situations where there were avenues through which Converse could have and should have handled his disputes, but instead chose to mount personal attacks on those with whom he had disputes through letters and barrages in the media.</p>
<p>One such incident occurred when Converse received the below average grade in the appellate advocacy course, and he wrote letters to various individuals regarding his arguments. Converse testified that he wrote letters to members of the South Dakota Supreme Court, Judge Richard Posner, Judge Alex Kozinski, and others, but filed no formal appeal. Moreover, upon return of the nude photograph, Converse testified that he redisplayed the photograph to force the issue with the university, but chose not to pursue any action regarding the alleged violation of his rights. There was also the incident regarding Converse’s internship with the U.S. Attorney’s office, where Converse went outside established procedures, arranged for the internship on his own, and then complained to all faculty and to members of the South Dakota bar when his request was denied for not complying with established procedures. Finally, there was Converse’s production and marketing of the T-shirt containing a nude depiction of Vickrey on a hot dog as a result of the ongoing tension between Vickrey and himself. Converse is 48 years old, and his actions cannot be excused as isolated instances of youthful indiscretions.</p>
<p>Taken together with the other incidents previously discussed, the evidence clearly shows that Converse is prone to turbulence, intemperance, and irresponsibility; characteristics which are not acceptable in one seeking admission to the Nebraska bar. In light of Converse’s admission that such conduct would be inappropriate were he already an attorney, we reiterate that we will not tolerate conduct by those applying for admission to the bar that would not be tolerated were that person already an attorney. Furthermore, Converse has consistently exhibited a tendency to cause disruption and then go to some arena outside the field of law to settle the dispute, often to an arena not specifically designed for dispute resolution. As explained by Justice Stewart in <em>Law Students Research Council v. Wadmond</em>,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>a State is constitutionally entitled to make an inquiry [into the moral character and past conduct] of an applicant for admission to a profession dedicated to the peaceful and reasoned settlement of disputes between men, and between a man and his government. The very Constitution that the appellants invoke stands as a living embodiment of that ideal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record before us reflects that the Commission conducted such an inquiry and, at the conclusion thereof, correctly determined that Converse possessed a moral character inconsistent with one “dedicated to the peaceful and reasoned settlement of disputes,” but, rather, more consistent with someone who wishes to go outside the field of law and settle disputes by mounting personal attacks and portraying himself as the victim and his opponent as the aggressor. Such disruptive, hostile, intemperate, threatening, and turbulent conduct certainly reflects negatively upon those character traits the applicant must prove prior to being admitted to the Nebraska bar, such as honesty, integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>The result might have been different if Converse had exhibited only a “single incident of rudeness or lack of professional courtesy,” but such is simply not the case. The record clearly establishes that he seeks to resolve disputes not in a peaceful manner, but by personally attacking those who oppose him in any way and then resorting to arenas outside the field of law to publicly humiliate and intimidate those opponents. Such a pattern of behavior is incompatible with what we have required to be obligatory conduct for attorneys, as well as for applicants to the bar.</p>
<p>Converse has exhibited a clear lack of self-restraint and lack of judgment, and our de novo review of the record leads us to independently conclude that Converse has exhibited such a pattern of acting in a hostile and disruptive manner as to render him unfit for the practice of law in Nebraska. We conclude that the Commission’s determination to deny Converse’s application was correct, and Converse’s third assignment of error is therefore without merit.</p>

<section id="conclusion-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Commission correctly determined that Converse possessed insufficient moral character and was unfit to practice law in the State of Nebraska. This determination was based on an inquiry into Converse’s moral character that was both proper and constitutionally permissible. Finding no error in the Commission’s determination or the process used to reach that determination, we affirm the Commission’s denial of application.</p>

<p>This case comes before us on an application by the petitioner Roger I. Roots (petitioner or Roots) seeking admission to the bar of the State of Rhode Island. Roots, who was born in October, 1967, is a 1999 graduate of the Roger Williams University School of Law. Following his law-school graduation, he took and passed the Rhode Island bar examination. In accordance with its usual procedures, this Court’s Committee on Character and Fitness (committee) examined Roots’s record and interviewed him after he had passed the bar examination. Because the committee had serious concerns relating to his character and fitness to become a member of the bar of this state, it conducted a number of hearings to determine whether it would recommend Roots’s admission to the bar. [After the hearings, the majority of the committee, with two members dissenting, voted in favor of Roots’s admission.]</p>
<p>To avoid an unduly long recitation of the pertinent facts concerning Roots’s application, the various reports that the majority and minority members prepared are attached to this opinion and made a part hereof. The report of the majority is appended and marked as exhibit A. The concurring report recommending admission is appended and marked as exhibit B. The minority report that Chairman Steven M. McInnis wrote is appended and marked as exhibit C. The dissenting opinion of the Attorney General’s designee is appended and marked as exhibit D. All these reports contain very similar accounts of the factual elements underlying the reports of the members of the committee. Nevertheless, we shall attempt to set forth in this opinion the important facts and circumstances that we believe justify our conclusion.</p>
<p>Through its hearings and by examining the material submitted in support of and in opposition to the application, the committee sought to resolve three major areas of concern about the petitioner: (1) his criminal record; (2) his candor and veracity; and (3) his ability to take and abide by the attorney’s oath. Some of the evidence was documentary in nature. In addition, extensive testimony was taken from the petitioner himself. The three areas of concern shall be dealt with separately in this opinion.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that Roots’s application should be denied without prejudice to Roots reapplying at some later date after he has proven that he has truly rehabilitated himself.</p>

<section id="petitioners-criminal-record" class="level5 page-columns page-full">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="petitioners-criminal-record">Petitioner’s Criminal Record</h5>
<p>In 1985, when he was eighteen years old, Roots was charged with and convicted of shoplifting in the State of Florida. He had relocated there after leaving his home in Montana during his freshman year in high school. In his bar application, Roots admitted that, following his arrest for this crime, he “failed to appear at his scheduled hearing on the matter.” He conceded that he was aware that he needed to attend the hearing but claims that his immaturity at the time caused him to disregard the court’s order. Within two months, however, the Orlando police rearrested him on the same charge. He was then detained until he could be presented to a judge. And even though the court still treated him with leniency, Roots shirked his responsibility to abide by the terms of his probation when he failed to perform the community-service condition of his sentence. (He admitted in his application to the bar that he just “left Orlando without performing the community service.”)</p>
<p>Within a year, however, he was arrested again in Florida and convicted of yet another crime, the felony of resisting arrest with violence. Generally, this crime involves disobeying, with the use of force (as opposed to mere flight), a police officer’s lawful attempt to arrest an alleged criminal. As reflected in the police report and in Roots’s law school application, the alleged facts of the crime reveal that Roots’s truck had collided with another vehicle. A police officer arrived at the accident scene and an argument ensued between Roots and the officer. When the officer learned that Roots had failed to pay two fines for separate moving violations and was driving on a suspended license, he attempted to take Roots into custody but Roots physically resisted the arrest. Although a federal sentencing judge would later characterize this incident as minor because, in attempting to subdue Roots, the police officer struck the only actual blow, a Florida sentencing judge, who presumably was more familiar with the relevant facts and circumstances, ultimately sentenced Roots to fifty-one weeks in prison following his <em>nolo contendere</em> plea after he again violated his initial three-year-probation sentence.</p>
<p>The petitioner then left Florida and moved to Wyoming, where he attended the Northwest Community College in Powell, Wyoming. While there, he exhibited in class a homemade air gun that he had constructed. (This may have been part of a speech presentation.) Because the authorities knew that petitioner had a prior record, they searched his dormitory room. There, they found additional weapons, including an automatic pistol, an automatic rifle with approximately 500 rounds of ammunition, and an assault rifle described as an AK-47. The petitioner was charged in federal court with being a felon in possession of firearms and with the possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of various federal statutes. Pursuant to a plea agreement, petitioner pled guilty to the registration count (relating to the air gun). The other counts were dismissed. A federal judge sentenced petitioner to twenty months in federal prison on January 10, 1992. This sentence terminated on April 4, 1993. As previously mentioned, the federal judge indicated that the petitioner’s felony conviction for resisting arrest with violence in Florida was not as serious an offense as might appear on the surface since the only injury was to the officer’s hand when he struck the petitioner in the face. Nevertheless, it was established that in purchasing the various weapons, the petitioner had filled out a number of forms in which he had misrepresented his status as a person convicted of a felony in Florida.</p>
<p>The applicant’s criminal record also includes the following:</p>
<p>(1) On at least eight occasions from the spring of 1986 to as recently as the winter of 1997, Roots was caught speeding and ordered to pay fines. These moving-traffic violations occurred in Utah, Washington, and Montana.</p>
<p>(2) Roots apparently ignored his previous driver’s license suspensions and flouted these dispositions because he later was charged in Georgia not once but twice in 1989 for driving on a suspended license. On the first occasion he not only drove on a suspended license, but also was issued citations for driving without a license, without insurance, and without proper registration. On the second such occasion, he was again driving on an expired registration plate and a suspended license. Roots’s bar application explains his conduct thus:</p>
<p>“I was without sufficient money for insurance or registration. I made it to work for several days but was pulled over by another officer only a couple days later. Again, I was arrested for driving without a license, registration, or insurance. * * * To this day I do not know what became of the cases in Georgia.”</p>
<p>On the present record, we do not know whether Roots has satisfied whatever lawfully imposed fines he was obliged to pay in Georgia. Apparently, he has not inquired about what present responsibilities — or possible warrants for his arrest based on his failure to resolve these matters — he still may have outstanding in Georgia.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Nothing in the record shows that Roots has resolved these matters. Moreover, even if Roots formerly lacked sufficient funds to pay for his automobile insurance or registration, he should have arranged to use public transportation or pursued other alternatives (for example, carpooling with friends or co-employees), rather than driving continuously on a suspended or revoked license as he did when he was caught doing so on three separate occasions.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;4 in opinion) Roots also has not accounted for his 1986 Utah speeding and reckless driving violations. His bar application lists the disposition or fine for these speeding and reckless driving violations as “u/k,” which we assume means “unknown.” Although Roots has not forgotten about these violations, he has neglected to determine for over fourteen years whether any sanctions remain outstanding against him in Utah for these transgressions.</p></div></div><p>Every prospective attorney in this state must complete an application that asks for a listing of all the candidate’s “violations of * * * traffic laws or ordinances other than parking offenses.” This part of the application is not superfluous nor a mere incursion into the applicant’s privacy, and it should not be so considered. Rather, it bears a logical and appropriate relationship to the ability of a prospective attorney in this state to maintain respect for and to uphold the law. And although repeated violations of various traffic laws, in isolation, may not preclude a candidate from admission to the bar, they certainly are relevant to the moral fitness and good-character determination that must be made when evaluating the qualifications of prospective attorneys.</p>
<p>(3) In Florida, Roots was convicted of providing a false statement to the authorities. To be sure, Roots has admitted that he provided a false name, but it should go without saying that this crime also reflects upon a candidate’s ability to serve the public as an attorney, as well as upon the applicant’s candor and truthfulness.</p>
<p>In their totality, these various citations, misdemeanors, and felonies that Roots has accumulated over the years present sufficient evidence to warrant, at minimum, a significant delay in acting favorably upon his application for admission to the Rhode Island bar, especially in light of the fact that Roots has admittedly ignored and violated the terms of his two previous probationary periods. Indeed, Roots’s first probation required him to perform community services — yet he chose to ignore that mandate from the Florida court. Instead, it was only after he scuffled with an arresting police officer — itself a display of disobedience to the officer’s attempt to effect a lawful arrest — and again disobeyed the terms of his probation, that Roots was ultimately forced to serve time in prison.</p>
<p>We recognize that Roots has not been convicted of violating any criminal laws since his conviction on the federal weapons charge and since his release from prison in 1993 after serving his federal jail sentence of twenty months. We also acknowledge and commend Roots’s award-winning writings, his law-school class rank, his position on the student newspaper, and his service on the Roger Williams University Law Review. On the other hand, while these more recent accomplishments are indeed praiseworthy, they are largely irrelevant in establishing his moral fitness and good character to practice as a member of our bar. Indeed, no one has sought to disqualify Roots based on his academic incompetency or lack of intelligence. On the contrary, his record in this regard is conceded to be outstanding. But even some notorious criminals can point with pride to their relative intelligence. Thus, mere intelligence and academic achievement do not necessarily equate to moral fitness and good character, both of which are preconditions to becoming a member of our bar.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these more recent positive factors, it is our belief that we have not yet had enough opportunity to conclude that Roots has totally rehabilitated himself, especially because his conduct during the years leading up to and including the filing of his bar application raises further questions about the depth, scope, and extent of his alleged rehabilitation. Indeed, his probationary status on the federal-weapons conviction expired only a mere four years ago, after which he then enrolled in law school and continued to engage in activities that cast doubt on his candor, truthfulness, and ability to take the attorney’s oath in good faith.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-petitioners-lack-of-candor-and-truthfulness">The Petitioner’s Lack of Candor and Truthfulness</h5>
<p>It has been established that the petitioner was not truthful in applying for the purchase of firearms. It also has been established that petitioner was not truthful in answering a question on the bar application about the use of aliases, although he did admit to having used three aliases: Carl Davis, Rodger Roop, and Roger Bell. He indicated on his application that these aliases were used for the purpose of attending school, writing, and telephone fundraising. In his testimony before the committee, however, he admitted that the use of the alias Carl Davis was to help him evade the law after he was indicted for the weapons charge in Montana. When he assisted in a senatorial campaign, he also used another alias, Roger Bell, in order to hide his true identity when salary payments were made to him. The minority report that Chairman McInnis submitted concluded that Roots’s lack of candor in this respect would not be consistent with allowing petitioner to practice law.</p>
<p>We have recently affirmed that “the attorney-client relationship is ‘one of mutual trust, confidence, and good will,’ in which the attorney ‘is bound to * * * the most scrupulous good faith.’” A central purpose of requiring character review as part of the attorney-admission process is to protect those members of the public who might become clients of the practicing lawyer from those attorneys who are so morally or ethically challenged that they are unable to demonstrate the type of good character and moral fitness requisite to serving in a fiduciary capacity. As Mr.&nbsp;Justice Frankfurter once observed, lawyers stand</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘as a shield’ * * * in defense of right and to ward off wrong. From a profession charged with such responsibilities there must be exacted those qualities of truth-speaking, of a high sense of honor, of granite discretion, of the strictest observance of fiduciary responsibility, that have, throughout the centuries, been compendiously described as ‘moral character.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fiduciary position of trust that a lawyer assumes vis-à-vis his or her clients demands that individuals whom this Court admits to the bar should be worthy of the confidence that members of the public repose in them. An equal and complementary concern is to safeguard the administration of justice from those who might subvert it through misrepresentations, falsehoods, or incomplete disclosures when full disclosure is necessary.</p>
<p>As we have noted previously, Roots was not truthful in applying to buy firearms. Indeed, he repeatedly checked a box indicating that he was <em>not</em> a convicted felon when he applied for his gun purchases, despite previously having been convicted of a felony. Thereafter, Roots was convicted for violently resisting arrest, and ultimately spent close to a year in prison for that offense after violating his initial three-year-probation sentence. He was also well aware of his convictions at the time he applied to buy his various assault weapons, yet he failed to disclose them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Roots admitted to the committee that he was less than forthcoming on his bar application about the reason for his use of the “Carl Davis” alias. Significantly, Roots submitted this untruthful application for admittance to the bar <em>in 1999.</em> When pressed about this discrepancy, Roots was unable to reconcile these contradictory statements.</p>
<p>Moreover, as mentioned above, Roots already had been convicted criminally of providing a false statement to the authorities. Such a record of dishonesty, combined with Roots’s other criminal misconduct and recent fabrication on his bar application, appears to us to justify at least a several-year delay before Roots’s application even should be considered again for his possible admission to the bar. And Roots’s use of an alias to mask his “unsavory” connections to white supremacy groups while working for the Committee to Reelect Conrad Burns, and his use of false indorsements on his paychecks, are simply further reasons for this Court to deny Roots’s application at this time.</p>
<p>In sum, then, we agree with the minority report that this applicant’s lack of candor is inconsistent with admitting him to practice law at this time.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ability-to-abide-by-the-attorneys-oath">Ability to Abide by the Attorney’s Oath</h5>
<p>Pursuant to Article II, Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules, “every person who is admitted as attorney and counselor at law shall take in open court the following engagement:”</p>
<p>“‘You solemnly swear that in the exercise of the office of attorney and counselor you will do no falsehood, nor consent to any being done; you will not wittingly or willingly promote, sue or cause to be sued any false or unlawful suit; or give aid, or consent to the same; you will delay no man’s cause for lucre or malice; you will in all respects demean yourself as an attorney and counselor of this court and of all other courts before which you may practice uprightly and according to law, with fidelity as well to the court as to your client; and that you will support the constitution and laws of this state and the constitution and laws of the United States. So help you God.’”</p>
<p>Beginning in 1993 petitioner has published a number of articles — including articles as recent as 1998 — that express explicit racial and ethnic bias as well as contempt and disdain for the federal government. His 1993 article is entitled “100 Truths and One Lie” and purports to establish that members of the black race are inferior to members of the white race. Excerpts from this work are set forth in the minority report. Moreover, as recently as 1998, Roots has written that he disavows the “de facto” regime of the United States government, its laws, and, apparently, its Constitution. Similarly, he has written in support of the bogus liens that the Freemen in Montana have attempted to place on federal officials who, in his opinion, have violated certain dictates that the Freemen espouse. It is noteworthy that Roots expressed these views in writing even while he was attending law school in 1998. Roots, however, now attempts to retreat from that stance. He would now have us believe that, consistent with the oath all prospective attorneys must take, he now can swear that he will support the constitution and the laws of this state as well as those of the federal government. This oath, as well as similar oaths that prospective attorneys across the United States must take, does not violate any individual constitutional right that Roots may have to express his contrary views.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States Supreme Court has stated that “citizens have a right under our constitutional system to criticize government officials and agencies. * * * Government censorship can no more be reconciled with our national constitutional standard of freedom of speech and press when done in the guise of determining ‘moral character,’ than if it should be attempted directly.” Thus, we have no intention or desire to censor or to punish Roots for his past or present political views or for exercising his rights of free speech. Nevertheless, when as here, a candidate for admission to the bar of a state has published writings that communicate his or her explicit refusal to accept our federal government as the legitimate government of this country, such a candidate raises legitimate questions about whether he or she in good faith can take and abide by the attorney’s oath to support the laws and the constitution of the United States while in the exercise of the office of attorney and counselor. For example, if a candidate for admission to the bar were to express the view that, in his or her opinion, the laws and constitution of the United States were illegitimate and, for that reason, unsupportable, but that in the exercise of his or her office as an attorney or counselor, he or she still could and, therefore, would swear to support that constitution and those laws, then the committee and this Court would be entitled, we believe, to view that candidate’s professed oath-taking ability with some degree of skepticism — especially if the candidate were a convicted felon with a history indicating a recurring lack of truthfulness and candor. While it is possible to draw and maintain a sharp line between a lawyer’s personal beliefs and his or her professional conduct, a predictive assessment of a prospective lawyer’s ability to take and abide by the attorney’s oath is a fair subject for character review when considering an applicant for admission to the bar. Here, Roots bore the burden at all times to demonstrate his moral fitness and character to practice as a lawyer in this state. But his recent 1997-1998 publications and comments disavowing the legitimacy of our federal government — especially when considered in light of his criminal record and history of other misconduct indicating a lack of forthrightness and candor — give us pause in accepting his avowal to us that he can now in good faith take and abide by the requisite attorney’s oath.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in reaching this conclusion, we agree with the majority of the committee that the First Amendment inhibits both the committee and this Court from denying membership in the bar to the petitioner because of his political beliefs and unorthodox political and social ideas. All of these cases related to applicants who either were or had been at one time members of the Communist Party or refused to answer questions relating to their membership in an organization (presumably the Communist Party) that advocated the violent overthrow of the government of the United States. We also recognize, as did the majority members of the committee, that neither a criminal record nor the political views of an applicant constitute an automatic bar to his or her admission. Yet both may be <em>relevant</em> in assessing (1) the applicant’s candor, honesty, sincerity, and good faith in professing a willingness to take and abide by the requisite attorney’s oath, and (2) the ability of the applicant, in the exercise of his or her office as an attorney and counselor, to support the constitution and laws of the United States.</p>
<p>The petitioner has stated to the committee and to this Court that he will not only take the attorney’s oath if admitted to the bar, but that he will abide by it. He stated unequivocally under oath to this Court that he would not discriminate against any person for racial or ethnic reasons. He further stated that he would abide by the lawyer’s oath in all respects without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. And he has stated to the committee that he no longer entertains his extremist views on the illegitimacy of the government of the United States.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion, however, that the prior record of the petitioner — including his criminal past and the other conduct referenced above demonstrating his lack of candor and truthfulness — casts such doubt upon the sincerity of Roots’s professed willingness to abide by the terms of the oath that he must take as a member of the bar of this state that his application should be denied at this time.</p>

<section id="conclusion-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h4>
<p>For the above reasons, we conclude that Roots’s application to the bar should be denied. The record in this case reveals far too many recent and past criminal acts, instances of untruthfulness, and a lingering inability of this candidate to take the requisite attorney’s oath in good faith. Thus, we cannot endorse Roots’s admission to the bar of this state at this time. Nevertheless, our denial of his application shall not preclude the possibility of Roots reapplying for and obtaining approval of his admission to the bar at some later time, but no sooner than two years from the date of this opinion. Moreover, if Roots reapplies for admission to the bar of this state within three years from the date of this opinion, he shall not be required to retake the bar examination. However, in addition to satisfying the committee’s usual criteria, he shall be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the committee and, ultimately to this Court, that, during the period between the date of this opinion and his reapplication:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He has secured and maintained gainful employment;</p></li>
<li><p>He has kept the peace and been of good behavior;</p></li>
<li><p>His writings and other conduct are consistent with his ability to take the attorney’s oath in good faith;</p></li>
<li><p>His previous motor vehicle and driving violations and any resulting sanctions in the states of Georgia and Utah have been satisfied and are no longer outstanding;</p></li>
<li><p>He has performed <em>pro bono publico</em> services of a substantial and continuing nature;</p></li>
<li><p>His post-1993 conduct and achievements outweigh the misconduct and other detrimental factors detailed in this opinion and, thus, are better indications of his moral character and fitness to practice law than his previous misconduct.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, we hereby deny Roots’s application without prejudice to his reapplication at some later time (no sooner than two years) when a more accurate and adequate assessment of Roots’s professed rehabilitation can be undertaken.</p>

<p>Applicant, a 47-year-old resident of New York, graduated from law school in 2000 and passed the bar examination in New York in February 2018. Following a hearing, this Court’s Committee on Character and Fitness issued a decision recommending that applicant be admitted to the practice of law subject to certain conditions. The Committee’s recommendation has now been referred to the Court for determination.</p>
<p>It is applicant’s burden to demonstrate that he possesses the character and general fitness requisite for admission After graduating law school, from 2001 to 2011, applicant engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in New York for nearly ten years. At that time, applicant, who had not yet taken the bar examination and was not licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction, applied for and was subsequently hired as an attorney, working for two different law firms in New York during the relevant time period. For nearly a decade, therefore, he held himself out as a licensed attorney to his employers and the general public and practiced law, ultimately becoming a partner in one of the law firms.</p>
<p>Applicant’s malfeasance was ultimately discovered by one of his employers after he intentionally misrepresented the status of a pending matter to one of his direct supervisors and was asked to resign from the firm. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered that applicant was also not licensed to practice law in New York. In turn, applicant was subsequently indicted for various charges, including grand larceny in the second degree, practicing or appearing as an attorney-at-law without being admitted and registered and offering a false instrument for filing in the second degree. He ultimately pleaded guilty to grand larceny in the second degree, a class C felony, and was sentenced to five years of probation.</p>
<p>Contrary to the conclusion of the Committee, given the serious nature of applicant’s prior illegal conduct, we find that he has failed to proffer sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to warrant his conditional admission to the practice of law at this time. Although the record indicates that applicant’s illegal conduct was attributable, at least in part, to depression and alcohol abuse, he admittedly has not engaged in any mental health or substance abuse treatment since such time. His failure to take any meaningful action to address the underlying issues that he claims contributed to his decade-long saga of practicing law without a license provides little assurance that he will not engage in similar misconduct in the future. Our concern in this regard is exacerbated by the fact that, despite his prior felony conviction and the fact that he is not presently admitted to practice law in any jurisdiction, the biography page on his present employer’s website nevertheless represented that he was employed as “Senior Counsel,” suggesting that, to date, applicant still does not appreciate the gravity of misrepresenting his attorney licensure status.</p>
<p>We are also troubled by applicant’s lack of candor during the admissions process. Applicant failed to disclose on his application questionnaire that his resignation from one of the law firms where he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law was precipitated, in part, by his fabrication of a court order—a deliberate attempt to deceive both his employer and his client regarding the status of a pending matter.[^Anon1] Additionally, on his application, applicant only disclosed that he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law at a single law firm in New York from 2005 to 2011. It was only upon questioning at his hearing that he disclosed that he had also interviewed and been hired for another attorney position with a separate law firm in New York, where he was employed from 2001 to 2005. Accordingly, applicant’s engagement in the unauthorized practice of law in this State commenced four years earlier than what he represented on his application.</p>
<p>Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we conclude that applicant has failed to demonstrate that he presently possesses the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law and, therefore, we decline to adopt the Committee’s recommendation, and deny his application.</p>
<p>Ordered that the application for admission is denied.</p>
<p>[^Anon1] (n.2 in opinion) Applicant’s lack of disclosure in this regard is significant given that the commission of such an egregious offense would have been grounds for the imposition of professional discipline if he had, in fact, been admitted to the practice of law in this State at that time.</p>

<p>Applicant passed the February 2008 New York State bar exam and the State Board of Law Examiners certified him for admission to this Court. The Committee on Character and Fitness has completed its investigation of his application for admission, including an interview of applicant.</p>
<p>Applicant has disclosed various student loans with balances now totaling about $430,000. He has stated that the loans are currently delinquent but professes good faith intentions to pay them. He has attributed his nonpayment to the downturn in the economy and bad faith negotiations on the part of some of the loan servicers. Our review of the application indicates that the disbursement dates of the loans cover a 20-year period, from as early as 1985. Applicant has not made any substantial payments on the loans. He has not been flexible in his discussions with the loan servicers. Under all the circumstances herein, we conclude that applicant has not presently established the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="people-v.-alfani-125-a.-671-n.y.-1919">People v. Alfani, 125 A. 671 (N.Y. 1919)</h3>
<p><strong>Crane, J.</strong></p>
<p>The defendant was convicted by the Special Sessions of the city of New York, borough of Brooklyn, of violating section 270 of the Penal Law. He was not an attorney and counselor-at-law, but had for a long period of time drawn legal papers and instruments for hire and held himself out to the public as being in that business. His conviction was reversed by the Appellate Division on the ground that such acts did not constitute practicing law and, therefore, were in nowise contrary to the statute.</p>
<p>The question is fairly presented whether the things done by Alfani are open to the public generally or require a license from the state before a person can perform them for compensation and as an occupation.</p>
<p>Henry Alfani had lived at 475 Park avenue, Brooklyn, New York, since 1888. In the basement he had an office in which he carried on a real estate and insurance business. Distinct from such work he also drew legal papers, contracts for real estate, deeds, mortgages, bills of sale and wills. A large sign placed over his dining-room or basement window bore the words in big letters “Notary Public—Redaction of all legal papers.” The defendant said “redaction” meant the drawing of legal papers. He was sixty years of age and evidently an Italian, as he testified in part through the Italian interpreter.</p>
<p>On December 27, 1917, two investigators of the state industrial commission called on Alfani at his office and asked him to look after a matter for them. Gallo, one of the men, said his name was George Lecas and that he lived at 23 Cook street, Brooklyn, where he had a soda water stand which together with a stock of cigars, cigarettes, candies and malted milk he had sold to the other man whom he introduced as Geannelis. The terms of the sale were these: the purchaser agreed to assume the seller’s contract to pay five dollars twice a month to the American Siphon Company from which the fountain had been obtained, $65 being still due thereon; the stock was to be $26 cash and the good will $145 to be paid for by Geannelis—$50 that night, $50 January 15th and $45 January 31st. The last payment was to be extended ten days if the purchaser was unable to meet it on time. The defendant advised that a bill of sale be drawn and that the purchaser give back a chattel mortgage. He explained about the necessity of filing the mortgage in the county clerk’s office and the foreclosure by a city marshal in case of non-payment. The papers were drawn and executed for which the defendant charged and received four dollars. Before leaving Gallo said: “In case I have any trouble of any kind and I need any legal advice can I come back to you?” to which Alfani replied, “Yes.”</p>
<p>By section 270 of the Penal Law it is a misdemeanor for any natural person “to make it a business to practice as an attorney-at-law * * * or to hold himself out to the public as being entitled to practice law as aforesaid, or in any other manner, * * * without having first been duly and regularly licensed and admitted to practice law in the courts of record of this state.” To practice or to represent as being entitled to practice law in any manner is prohibited to those not lawyers.</p>
<p>The Appellate Division was of the opinion that this section related only to practice connected with court or legal proceedings. The restriction is broader than this for effect must be given to the words “or in any other manner.” The words “as aforesaid” have reference to practice in the courts mentioned, and the following “or in any other manner” refer to the practice as an attorney-at-law out of court and not in legal proceedings. Practicing as an attorney-at-law in or out of court or holding oneself out as entitled to so practice is the offense. Not only is this the natural reading of the section but the lower court in a previous decision held that practicing law was not confined to court work.</p>
<p>In <em>Matter of Duncan</em> it is said: “It is too obvious for discussion that the practice of law is not limited to the conduct of cases in courts. According to the generally understood definition of the practice of law in this country, it embraces the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts, and in addition conveyancing, the preparation of legal instruments of all kinds, and in general all advice to clients and all action taken for them in matters connected with the law. An attorney-at-law is one who engages in any of these branches of the practice of law.”</p>
<p>In <em>Eley v. Miller</em> the court stated: “As the term is generally understood, the practice of law is the doing or performing services in a court of justice in any matter depending therein, throughout its various stages, and in conformity to the adopted rules of procedure. But in a larger sense it includes legal advice and counsel, and the preparation of legal instruments and contracts by which legal rights are secured, although such matter may or may not be depending in a court.”</p>
<p>To make it a business to practice as an attorney-at-law not being a lawyer is the crime. Therefore, to prepare as a business legal instruments and contracts by which legal rights are secured and to hold oneself out as entitled to draw and prepare such as a business is a violation of the law.</p>
<p>It does not lead us to a conclusion to investigate the powers of notaries public under the Roman law or of scriveners and notaries under the English system past or present. The legislators who enacted section 270 knew what practicing law was in this state as many of them were of the profession and they were dealing with that as carried on here at the present day. It is common knowledge for which the above authorities were hardly necessary, that a large, if not the greater, part of the work of the bar to-day is out of court or office work. Counsel and advice, the drawing of agreements, the organization of corporations and preparing papers connected therewith, the drafting of legal documents of all kinds, including wills, are activities which have long been classed as law practice. The legislature is presumed to have used the words as persons generally would understand them, and not being technical or scientific terms “to practice as an attorney-at-law” means to do the work, as a business, which is commonly and usually done by lawyers here in this country.</p>
<p>The reason why preparatory study, educational qualifications, experience, examination and license by the courts are required, is not to protect the bar as stated in the opinion below but to protect the public. Similar preparation and license are now demanded for the practice of medicine, surgery, dentistry and other callings, and the list is constantly increasing as the danger to the citizen becomes manifest and knowledge reveals how it may be avoided.</p>
<p>Why have we in this state such strict requirements for admission to the Bar? A regents’ certificate or college degree followed by three years in a law school or an equivalent study in a law office marks the course to a bar examination which must finally be passed to entitle the applicant to practice as an attorney. Recognizing that knowledge and ability alone are insufficient for the standards of the profession, a character committee also investigates and reports upon the honesty and integrity of the man. And all of this with but one purpose in view and that to protect the public from ignorance, inexperience and unscrupulousness.</p>
<p>Is it only in court or in legal proceedings that danger lies from such evils? On the contrary, the danger there is at a minimum for very little can go wrong in a court where the proceedings are public and the presiding officer is generally a man of judgment and experience. Any judge of much active work on the bench has had frequent occasion to guide the young practitioner or protect the client from the haste or folly of an older one. Not so in the office. Here the client is with his attorney alone, without the impartial supervision of a judge. Ignorance and stupidity may here create damage which the courts of the land cannot thereafter undo. Did the legislature mean to leave this field to any person out of which to make a living? Reason says no. Practicing law as an attorney likewise covers the drawing of legal instruments as a business.</p>
<p>That such work is properly that of an attorney seems to be recognized by other provisions of law. Section 88 of the Judiciary Law, relating to the disbarment of attorneys, makes it the duty of the Appellate Division in each final order of suspension to forbid the giving to another of an opinion as to the law or its application or of any advice in relation thereto.</p>
<p>Section 835 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in substance that an attorney shall not be allowed to disclose a communication made by his client to him or his advice given thereon, in the course of his professional employment. Such communications have referred to a deed; an affidavit; a chattel mortgage and a bill of sale.</p>
<p>Also the summary power of courts over attorneys may be exercised in matters unrelated to court proceedings.</p>
<p>Even the instances cited below of scriveners and notaries public in foreign lands drawing legal papers sustain this contention, as the laws require such to be trained and experienced men.</p>
<p>The duties of notaries public here are defined by section 105 of the Executive Law. Only in the name is there a correspondence to the continental official.</p>
<p>All rules must have their limitations, according to circumstances and as the evils disappear or lessen. Thus a man may plead his own case in court, or draft his own will or legal papers. Probably he may ask a friend or neighbor to assist him.</p>
<p>We recognize that by section 270 and also 271 a person, not a lawyer, may appear for another in a court not of record outside cities of the first and second class. The results cannot be serious. The cases are generally of minor importance to the parties; such occasions are seldom frequent enough to make it a business, and the procedure is so informal as to constitute the judge really an arbiter in the dispute.</p>
<p>We must, therefore, in harmony with these views, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and affirm that of the Special Sessions.</p>
<p>** McLAUGHLIN, J. (dissenting).**</p>
<p>The defendant was convicted of violating section 270 of the Penal Law. [On appeal], the judgment of conviction was reversed and he was discharged. The People, by permission, appeal to this court.</p>
<p>So much of the section of the Penal Law under which the conviction was obtained as is material to the question presented on appeal, reads as follows: “Practicing or appearing as attorney without being admitted and registered. It shall be unlawful for any natural person to practice or appear as an attorney-at-law or as attorney and counsellor-at-law for another in a court of record in this state or in any court in the city of New York, or to make it a business to practice as an attorney-at-law or as an attorney and counsellor-at-law for another in any of said courts * * * or to hold himself out to the public as being entitled to practice law as aforesaid, or in any other manner, * * * without having first been duly and regularly licensed and admitted to practice law in the courts of record of this state * * *.”</p>
<p>The defendant, at the time stated in the information, was a notary public, living at 475 Park avenue, Brooklyn, in the basement of which he had a small office for the transaction of business. Over the entrance of the office was the following sign:</p>

<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="../img/Alfani.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Alfani sign</figcaption>

</div>
<p>On the 27th of December, 1917, one Gallo, special investigator of the state industrial commission, in company with one Geannelis, entered defendant’s office and he asked them what they wanted. Gallo stated that he was selling his store, which consisted of a soda water stand, together with a stock of cigars, cigarettes, etc., to Geannelis, for a certain consideration, which was named, part of which was to be paid down and the balance in installments. Gallo also stated there was a certain amount due to the American Siphon Company on the purchase price of the soda water fountain, which Geannelis was to assume and pay. The defendant advised that Gallo give a bill of sale to Geannelis and that he give a chattel mortgage for the amount remaining unpaid. He also explained it would be necessary to file the mortgage in the county clerk’s office, so that the same could be foreclosed by the city marshal in case of non-payment. His suggestions as to the bill of sale and mortgage were followed and he thereupon prepared the same, for which he was paid four dollars.</p>
<p>It is contended that this transaction, together with the sign, amounted to a violation of the provisions of the statute quoted. I have been unable to reach this conclusion. The statute, unless something is read into it which does not there appear, is to prohibit a natural person practicing or appearing as an attorney-at-law in the courts mentioned, or to hold himself out to the public as being entitled to practice in such courts. The defendant did neither. Clearly, the drafting of the bill of sale and chattel mortgage was not practicing or appearing as an attorney-at-law in any court. Nor did the words on the sign, “Redaction of all legal papers” indicate that he was holding himself out as entitled to practice in such courts. The words “in any other manner,” upon which stress is laid, relate to what precedes them in the sentence, viz., the courts referred to. The phrase, although general in its nature, is limited and qualified by the prior specific designations. The rule of ejusdem generis applies. Where the enumeration of specific things is followed by some more general word or phrase, such general word or phrase is held to refer to the things of the same kind.</p>
<p>At the time defendant was convicted it was not illegal, and is not now, for natural persons to draft papers usually intrusted to lawyers. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that in the rural districts of the state leases, deeds, bills of sale, chattel mortgages, wills and other instruments creating legal obligations are frequently prepared by laymen, notaries public and justices of the peace. Indeed, a natural person could, at the time defendant was convicted, appear for another in a Magistrate’s Court, or before a justice of the peace, except in cities of the first and second class, and receive pay therefor. This practice is recognized by section 271, which prohibits a person from receiving compensation for appearing as attorney in a court before any magistrate in any city of the first or second class, unless admitted to practice as an attorney and counsellor in the courts of record of the state. That the legislature did not intend to prohibit such practice is apparent from the fact that at its last session it amended section 271, so that it now includes cities of the third, as well as those of the first and second class.</p>
<p>To give to the words “in any other manner” the legal effect suggested would prohibit a natural person anywhere in the state from drawing a legal paper of any description, or appearing in any court. This, the legislature has not yet indicated its intent to do.</p>
<p>One of the well-settled rules of statutory construction is that statutory offenses cannot be established by implication and that acts in and of themselves innocent and lawful cannot be held to be criminal, unless there is a clear and unequivocal expression of the legislative intent to make them such.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the defendant was not guilty of violating section 270 of the Penal Law; that the Appellate Division was right in reversing the conviction and discharging him; and its judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.</p>

<p>Capital Associated Industries, Inc.&nbsp;(“CAI”) is a trade association representing North Carolina employers. As part of a plan to expand its membership, CAI wants to provide legal services to its members. But it cannot because state law forbids corporations from practicing law. Following unsuccessful lobbying efforts to change the law, CAI sued state prosecutors to enjoin the enforcement of state unauthorized practice of law (“UPL”) statutes against it. After the North Carolina State Bar intervened to defend the statutes, the defendants obtained summary judgment. On appeal, CAI contends that North Carolina’s UPL statutes violate its constitutional rights to free association, free speech, and commercial speech; lack a rational basis; are void for vagueness; and violate the state constitution. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>

<p>Since 1931, the State of North Carolina has forbidden corporations from practicing law. N.C. Gen Stat. § 84-5(a).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> To address the unauthorized practice of law, the State Bar and state prosecutors may sue for an injunction, and prosecutors may bring misdemeanor charges. The UPL statutes do, however, allow the practice of law by lawyer-owned professional corporations, public interest law firms, and in-house counsel representing their employers.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;[n.1 in opinion] North Carolina is not alone in doing so. Almost all other states have similar laws on the books. One state allows unincorporated nonprofit “associations” to practice law. And CAI points to trade associations practicing law in a few other states. But at least one of those states bans corporations from practicing law.</p></div></div><p>CAI is a North Carolina nonprofit corporation that claims a tax exemption under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(6) as a trade association of employers. It has about 1,100 North Carolina employers as members and describes its mission as fostering successful employment relationships. CAI charges its members an annual fee adjusted for each member’s size. It competes with for-profit businesses in providing some services, such as recruiting, background checks, consulting, training, conferences, and affirmative action planning.</p>
<p>One of the most popular services it provides its members is a call center, where members can speak to CAI’s staff of human resources experts. The experts can advise on HR issues. But they can’t give legal advice, even if they are licensed attorneys. So, when legal issues arise, CAI’s HR experts have to steer the conversation elsewhere, end the conversation, or refer the member to outside counsel.</p>
<p>While it disclaims any interest in representing its members in court, CAI would like to help them draft legal documents (such as contracts or employee handbooks) and answer questions about employment and labor law. If it could practice law, CAI would offer most legal services without charge as part of its membership fees, but it would charge hourly fees for certain services.</p>
<p>CAI has spent years trying to change the UPL statutes as part of its “2X” development plan to double its membership and reach. In 2011, CAI’s lobbyists persuaded state lawmakers to introduce bills that would have allowed corporations to practice law. CAI tried and failed to get the State Bar to support the bills. The State Bar instead actively opposed the bills, and they were not enacted. CAI’s lobbying efforts met a similar fate in 2013. That same year, the State Bar adopted a proposed ethics opinion advising that CAI would violate the UPL statutes if it employed lawyers to give its members legal advice.</p>

<section id="b." class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.">B.</h5>
<p>After two failed bids to achieve its goals through legislation, CAI turned to the courts. It challenged the UPL statutes in federal district court, naming as defendants the attorney general of North Carolina and certain district attorneys. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would prevent enforcement of North Carolina’s UPL laws against it. It pleaded five claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (concerning due process, free association, free speech, vagueness, and commercial speech) and one claim under the state constitution.</p>
<p>The district court allowed the State Bar to intervene as a defendant. It then denied CAI’s motion for a preliminary injunction and the defendants’ motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings. After discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>
<p>Before the district court, State Bar representatives expressed concerns about nonlawyers controlling litigation and receiving attorney fees, confidentiality, excessive fees, and the State Bar’s inability to discipline corporations. Regarding CAI, they worried about conflicts of interest due to its large base of members and the fact that its directors and officers don’t have to be lawyers and thus wouldn’t have obligations under the State Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p>To assuage these concerns, CAI filed declarations from three trade organizations practicing law in other states, and it outlined a plan to comply with ethics rules. CAI’s lawyers would control legal services, make decisions about conflicts of interest, and have sole access to privileged communications. But CAI’s directors and president would set the attorneys’ salaries and the legal department’s budget. And CAI declined to offer assurances that it would require its directors and officers to be attorneys.</p>
<p>Some of CAI’s members testified that allowing CAI to practice law would mean that they could obtain more efficient and cost-effective legal representation. But almost all those members said they had received legal advice from private attorneys. Just one member said it had gone without counsel in low-risk situations, but even it found counsel for more serious matters. And according to CAI’s President and CEO, no member has left CAI because it doesn’t offer legal services.</p>
<p>Addressing the cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court first held that CAI had standing because it faced “a credible threat of prosecution” if it practiced law. The district court then turned to the merits and rejected all six of CAI’s claims, entering summary judgment for the defendants.</p>
<p>This appeal followed.</p>

<section id="iii." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iii.">III.</h4>
<p>We begin with CAI’s claim that the UPL statutes violate its freedom of association. CAI contends that it is an expressive association seeking to improve employment relationships in North Carolina and foster compliance with the law. By forbidding it from practicing law, CAI argues, the UPL statutes restrict its ability to carry out that expressive mission. We agree with the district court, however, that the UPL statutes do not unconstitutionally restrict CAI’s associational rights.</p>
<p>To support its argument, CAI relies on a line of cases beginning with <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> 371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963). In <em>Button,</em> the Supreme Court held that a Virginia law forbidding organizations from retaining attorneys to represent third parties infringed on the right of the NAACP and its members “to associate for the purpose of assisting persons who seek legal redress for infringements” of their civil and constitutional rights.</p>
<p>The Court emphasized that for the NAACP, litigation is “not a technique of resolving private differences; it is a means for achieving the lawful objectives of equality of treatment.” To win civil rights, the Court said, litigation may be the “sole practicable avenue” and the “most effective form of political association.” Thus, what was at stake was “securing constitutionally guaranteed civil rights,” not commercial ends. And as the Court took time to emphasize, the law as applied against the NAACP did not implicate “professionally reprehensible conflicts of interest.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has applied <em>Button</em> in two contexts. The first, involves public interest organizations like the NAACP. See <em>In re Primus</em>, 436 U.S. 412 (1978). In <em>Primus,</em> the Court held that South Carolina couldn’t forbid the ACLU from advising people of their legal rights and informing them that the ACLU could represent them for free. The Court compared the ACLU’s role to that of the NAACP in <em>Button</em> and contrasted it with “a group that exists for the primary purpose of financial gain.” It cast doubt on whether an organization operating for financial gain would receive the same protection as organizations that promote the common political aims of their members.</p>
<p>The second context involves labor unions. <em>See</em> <em>Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Va. ex rel. Va. State Bar,</em> 377 U.S. 1 (1964). The <em>Trainmen</em> Court held that Virginia couldn’t bar a union from recommending lawyers to its members for workers’ compensation suits. The Virginia law, the Court said, infringed on “the right of individuals and the public to be fairly represented in lawsuits authorized by Congress to effectuate a basic public interest” without adequate justification.</p>
<p>The Court has extended <em>Trainmen</em> twice. First, it held that Illinois couldn’t prevent a union from employing attorneys to represent its members in workers’ compensation claims. <em>United Mine Workers v. Ill. State Bar Ass’n,</em> 389 U.S. 217 (1967). While the Court considered that law unjustified, it emphasized that the state did possess an “interest in high standards of legal ethics.” Second, the Court held that Michigan couldn’t bar a union from recommending to its members certain attorneys who had agreed to a maximum fee. <em>United Transp. Union v. State Bar of Mich.,</em> 401 U.S. 576 (1971). “At issue,” the Court said, “is the basic right to group legal action” and the right to “meaningful access to the courts,” which required enabling union members to “meet the costs of legal representation.”</p>
<p>The “common thread running through” these cases is that “collective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right.” Critically, however, the cases distinguish between the commercial practice of law and “associating for non-commercial purposes to advocate the enforcement of legal and constitutional rights.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court emphasized this distinction in <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n</em>, 436 U.S. 447 (1978). In <em>Ohralik</em>, the Court rejected a challenge to an Ohio law forbidding in-person solicitation of clients. Solicitation of clients for commercial purposes, the Court held, did not implicate “political expression or an exercise of associational freedom” or “mutual assistance in asserting legal rights.”</p>
<p>As applied to CAI, North Carolina’s UPL laws are closer to the statute in <em>Ohralik</em> than the statutes in the <em>Button</em> cases. While this case is admittedly close, several considerations distinguish CAI’s proposed practice from the <em>Button</em> line of cases. First, what CAI seeks to accomplish would be for commercial ends and would address only private concerns. Second, it would not facilitate access to the courts. And third, it would pose ethical concerns not present in the <em>Button</em> cases.</p>
<p>When organizations like the NAACP and the ACLU solicit clients and retain lawyers to represent them, they express their commitment to expanding and guarding civil rights. CAI, in contrast, wants to help its members “resolve private differences” by drafting legal documents and advising employers on labor and employment issues. Its goal, as set forth in its 2X plan, is to increase revenues and recruit new members who will pay dues and additional legal fees. CAI would charge by the hour for some services. While other services would be included in its membership fees, CAI’s chairman said the trade association might increase its fees if it could practice law. CAI thus seeks to practice law for commercial ends, like a private attorney—not to associate for political or otherwise public goals. And while we accept that CAI engages in some expressive activity, CAI proposes to practice law for commercial ends, not to express a message.</p>
<p>Nor does CAI propose to engage in “collective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts.” As described in the record, CAI’s members have consistently had access to legal services and the courts. And CAI has no intention of litigating in any forum. So, unlike the organizations in the <em>Button</em> cases, CAI would not facilitate access to justice or vindicate its members’ constitutional or statutory rights. CAI’s proposed practice might reduce some of its members’ legal bills. But nothing in the record shows that CAI’s inability to practice law means that its members can’t “meet the costs of legal representation” or obtain “meaningful access to the courts.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has, moreover, extended associational rights only when the proposed practice of law wouldn’t raise ethical concerns. CAI’s proposed practice, in contrast, does raise ethical concerns. Specifically, its members would pay legal fees for representation by attorneys supervised by officers and directors who are not attorneys. That structure (even if housed in a nonprofit entity) could compromise the independence and professional judgment of the lawyers involved, and the corporation’s interests could trump loyalty to clients.</p>
<p>In sum, several features of CAI’s proposed practice distinguish it from the organizations in the <em>Button</em> cases. As a result, like the solicitation statute in <em>Ohralik,</em> North Carolina’s UPL statutes “only marginally affect … First Amendment concerns.” Because they do not “substantially impair the associational rights” of CAI, we need not examine whether the state’s interests suffice to justify them. We hold that the UPL statutes do not violate CAI’s associational rights.</p>
</section>
<section id="iv." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iv.">IV.</h4>
<p>Next, CAI argues that the UPL statutes unlawfully burden its freedom of speech. The district court rejected this claim based on the so-called “professional speech doctrine.” When the district court ruled, this circuit and others applied lesser standards of scrutiny to professionals’ speech to clients. But after the briefing in this appeal, the Supreme Court disapproved of this doctrine. <em>See</em> <em>Nat’l Inst. of Family &amp; Life Advocates v. Becerra (NIFLA)</em>, 138 S.Ct. 2361 (2018).</p>
<p>In <em>NIFLA,</em> the Court addressed a California law requiring certain clinics that primarily serve pregnant women to post notices about what services they didn’t offer and about free state services. Although the law applied in a professional context, the Court approached the case as it would any other involving compelled speech. It held that the law was content-based. And because it held that the law could not survive intermediate scrutiny, the Court declined to decide whether strict scrutiny should apply.</p>
<p>The Court did, however, recognize two situations in which states have broader authority to regulate the speech of professionals than that of nonprofessionals. First, there is “more deferential review” for requirements that professionals “disclose factual, noncontroversial information” in their commercial speech. Second, “states may regulate professional conduct, even though that conduct incidentally involves speech.” As examples of this latter category, the Court cited cases about malpractice, anticompetitive agreements, client solicitation, and informed consent.</p>
<p>On appeal, North Carolina describes the ban on corporate law practice as a regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech, which only needs to survive intermediate scrutiny. In contrast, CAI describes it as a content-based and identity-based regulation of speech that must survive strict scrutiny. As explained below, we agree with the state that the law passes—and only needs to pass—intermediate scrutiny.</p>
<section id="a.-1" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-1">A.</h5>
<p>North Carolina’s ban on the practice of law by corporations fits within <em>NIFLA</em>’s exception for professional regulations that incidentally affect speech. The ban is part of a generally applicable licensing regime that restricts the practice of law to bar members and entities owned by bar members. In this case, any impact the UPL statutes have on speech is incidental to the overarching purpose of regulating who may practice law.</p>
<p>Many laws that regulate the conduct of a profession or business place incidental burdens on speech, yet the Supreme Court has treated them differently than restrictions on speech. Bans on discrimination, price regulations, and laws against anticompetitive activities all implicate speech—some may implicate speech even more directly than licensing requirements. But the Supreme Court has analyzed them all as regulations of conduct.</p>
<p>As CAI recognizes, the practice of law has communicative and non-communicative aspects. The UPL statutes don’t target the communicative aspects of practicing law, such as the advice lawyers may give to clients. Instead, they focus more broadly on the question of who may conduct themselves as a lawyer. Licensing laws inevitably have some effect on the speech of those who are not (or cannot be) licensed. But that effect is merely incidental to the primary objective of regulating the conduct of the profession.</p>
</section>
<section id="b.-1" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-1">B.</h5>
<p>Having determined that the UPL statutes regulate conduct, we turn to the appropriate standard of review. CAI urges us to apply strict scrutiny, contending that the UPL statutes restrict speech based on the content and on the speaker. We think the correct reading of Supreme Court precedent, however, is that intermediate scrutiny should apply to regulations of conduct that incidentally impact speech.</p>
</section>
<section id="c." class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.">C.</h5>
<p>We turn then to consider whether North Carolina’s ban on the practice of law survives this standard of review. To survive intermediate scrutiny, the defendant must show “a substantial state interest” and a solution that is “sufficiently drawn” to protect that interest. North Carolina’s interest in regulating the legal profession to protect clients is at least substantial. In fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly described that interest in even stronger terms.</p>
<p>Barring corporations from practicing law is sufficiently drawn to protect that interest. Professional integrity could suffer if the state allows lawyers to practice on behalf of organizations owned and run by nonlawyers and to collect legal fees from clients. Nonlawyers would likely supervise lawyers representing third-party clients at CAI, which could compromise professional judgment and generate conflicts between client interests and the corporation’s interests.</p>
<p>The state has addressed these problems by proscribing law practice by organizations that pose the most danger, while exempting organizations that pose little danger. Professional corporations, for example, must be owned exclusively by lawyers. N.C. Gen.&nbsp;Stat. § 55B-4(2). And public interest law firms “must have a governing structure that does not permit” anyone except an “attorney duly licensed… to control the manner or course of the legal services rendered.” Plus, the restrictions on the fees such firms may receive makes it impossible for them break even (much less turn a profit) on legal work.</p>
<p>Another state legislature might balance the interests differently. But intermediate scrutiny requires only a “reasonable fit between the challenged regulation” and the state’s interest—not the least restrictive means. Because North Carolina has established a reasonable fit between its UPL statutes and a substantial government interest, the UPL statutes survive intermediate scrutiny.</p>

<p>CAI also argues that the UPL statutes deny it due process because they lack a rational basis. CAI doesn’t contend that its due process claim concerns fundamental rights, so the UPL statutes are only subject to rational basis review. To pass muster under rational basis review, legislation “need only be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.”</p>
<p>The state relies on the same justifications it provided in response to the First Amendment claims. As our precedent counsels, “there is a rational basis to restrict corporate … ownership of professional businesses” to protect consumers. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that the state’s justifications suffice. CAI’s remaining arguments—such as the availability of less restrictive means—are inapposite for rational basis review. We hold that the UPL statutes do not deny CAI due process.</p>

<section id="vi." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vi.">VI.</h4>
<p>CAI also contends that the UPL statutes are unconstitutionally vague because they fail to provide fair notice of what it means to practice law. A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it “fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” But “perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.”</p>
<p>To determine if a statute is vague, we examine both the statute itself and any limiting constructions from state courts or agencies. State law defines the term “practice law” as “performing any legal service.” N.C. Gen.&nbsp;Stat. § 84-2.1(a). The statutory definition provides a lengthy but unexhaustive list of what does and doesn’t count as a legal service. The statute prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law elaborates on the definition further. And North Carolina courts have expounded on this definition at length.</p>
<p>CAI’s vagueness challenge fails. The statutes and state case law collectively provide an extensive definition of what it means to practice law. Between them, a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice of what the UPL statutes prohibit. Indeed, CAI itself understood what it means to practice law well enough to avoid giving its members legal advice.</p>
<p>CAI points out that State Bar officials couldn’t present a clear answer to every hypothetical question asked in their depositions. But fair notice doesn’t require certainty about every hypothetical situation. We hold, therefore, that the UPL statutes are not void for vagueness.</p>

<section id="vii." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vii.">VII.</h4>
<p>CAI next contends that the UPL statutes violate the state constitution’s Monopoly Clause, which provides that “perpetuities and monopolies … shall not be allowed.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of North Carolina has interpreted this clause to allow “reasonable regulations” of commerce with a substantial relationship to public health, safety, or welfare. That court has long been deferential toward professional regulations, regularly upholding professional licensing requirements.</p>
<p>The state high court has twice upheld the ban on corporate law practice. In <em>Seawell,</em> the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed an injunction against a corporation for the unauthorized practice of law, holding that “the statute in question offends neither the State nor Federal Constitution.” And in <em>Gardner v. North Carolina State Bar,</em> that court held that an insurance company could not employ an attorney to represent its insureds, finding that “there is no merit to the argument” that the ban on corporate practice “violates Article I of the state constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment.” Although it is unclear whether <em>Seawell</em> and <em>Gardner</em> addressed Monopoly Clause arguments, they illustrate the leeway North Carolina courts give the legislature to regulate the legal profession.</p>
<p>It is well established that the practice of law affects the public interest and that the unregulated practice of law can pose a danger. Based on the applicable state case law, this court must conclude that the UPL statutes do not violate the Monopoly Clause.</p>
